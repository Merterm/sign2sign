# Multi-Lingual Project


## Main Directories
	- MultiLingualSign  (data and processing code)
		- CSL/data (CSL Daily dataset)
		- how2sign/ (ASL how2sign dataset)
		- PT/DGS (Germany dataset)
		

## Dataset Alignment
	We currrently align the language pairs by texts. I do not find the alingment algorithms but descriptions can be found in the paper. I would suggest try other ways to construt the high-quality pairs.
	- MultiLingualSign/code_/generate_pairs.py (important file to construct the pairwise dataset)
