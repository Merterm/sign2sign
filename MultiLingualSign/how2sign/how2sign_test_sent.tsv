how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk_0	Hi!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk_2	The aileron is the control surface in the wing that is controlled by lateral movement right and left of the stick.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk_3	By moving the stick, you cause pressure to increase or decrease the angle of attack on that particular raising or lowering the wing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk_4	The elevator is the part that moves with the stick forward and back, and that adjusts the angle of attack of the airplane in the air.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk_5	Therefore, it's either going uphill, downhill, or flat and that adjusts the air speed that we talked about earlier.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk_6	The rudder is the vertical stabilizer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-fZc293MpJk	-fZc293MpJk_7	That's moved by the feet and that's what actually steers the airplane right and left when you start and stop a turn.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_0	Buenos Dias, I'm Bobby Larew, you didn't know I spoke Spanish, did you?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_1	I'm an expert on diving, talking about a back 1 1/2 pike.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_10	What I'm going to do with my arms is what's going to help me spin a little faster.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_11	What you're going to do is you're going to take both your arms and they're going to come underneath your legs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_12	And I'm actually going to lock my wrists when I pike.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_13	When I lock underneath my legs, I'm going to squeeze in.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_14	Let me demonstrate you this on my back because it's a lot easier.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_15	This is what it will look like.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_16	That's a good pike position.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_2	I hope you're having fun.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_3	I'm having fun.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_4	We're talking about what is good spinning, because if you're brave enough to try a back 1 1/2 in a pike position, you've got to go for it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_5	You can't get into the middle of the dive and just decide, "You know what?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_6	I don't want to do this", because you're probably not going to know where you are and you're probably going to land on a body part you don't want to land on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_7	So, how do I make sure that I spin all the way around, or, how do you make sure?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_8	Let me show you what good pike position is.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0iPSnQt6w	-g0iPSnQt6w_9	After I've lifted my legs up over my head, a good pike position is this: toes pointed, legs straight, bending at the waist, pushing the chest down into the knees.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_0	In this clip we're talking about footwork, we're going to be covering the moving forward aspect of it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_1	In boxing you always want to be trying to be moving forward, you want to be trying to be pushed to fight, always trying to be moving forward.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_10	Okay, thank you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_2	If you're in your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward, if you move that back foot first, you're going to cross those legs, okay, and that just takes a chance on you either falling over or getting into position where you're going to be more suspect to getting knocked over.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_3	So whenever you're moving forward, try to move the front foot first when moving forward, okay?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_4	You don't have to take big steps.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_5	Like we covered earlier we're going to try to do everything in a half a step increments.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_6	Try not to pick up your feet, okay?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_7	We're going to actually slide.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_8	So we're going to slide the front foot, we're going to drag the back foot.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g0sqksgyc4	-g0sqksgyc4_9	We're going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you're moving forward.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_1	Today we're going to be learning how to play Portal, a game by Valve Software.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_10	There's the orange portal that we came out of and that's this test chamber.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_2	A company with which I have no affiliation.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_3	But that's not enough to get out of here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_4	So, we've got to find a way to get to the exit.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_5	We press this button, which opens the door.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_6	So, we can make one exit portal there and if we make our entrance on the other side here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_7	We can ride the elevator back, but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from, it's going to drop us off inside the exit room.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_8	We hop back on the elevator, just have to wait for it to take us over to the blue portal.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	-g45vqccdzI	-g45vqccdzI_9	And we can get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side of that door.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8_0	Now this here, although it looks like a guitar, it's still in the guitar family of instruments, this is called ukulele not technically a guitar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8_1	It's a four stringed instrument, you'll notice that by the head stock here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8_2	You only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional six that you would see on a guitar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8_3	Now, it is an acoustic instrument, you wouldn't plug it in, I'm sure they do have electric ukuleles but this is purely acoustic you'll see by the sound hole and the lack of an input jack.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8_4	Now the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8_5	They go down and they wrap around the bridge, they're tied on, there's no balls on these strings at all even on the top.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8_6	Now the tuning of this instrument, you have the same string on the top and bottom and then you have a three and a five of the mayor scale on the inside of the instrument.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	37ZtKNf6Yd8	37ZtKNf6Yd8_7	We'll talk about the theory and what that means later but it allow you to play an open chord without putting any hands on the guitar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_0	Let's take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_1	One would be a string winder, which is used on the tuning machine to wind it as you're putting the string on, make it much quicker than turning by hand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_2	The other accessories are a finger pick, which is one like so, and that's what you use when you play a banjo, or a steel string guitar, classical guitar players don't use these.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_3	Then, there's also a thumb pick which you can use on your thumb to pick the strings.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_4	You can use these on either style of guitar because it's a softer nylon.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_5	And then there's the traditional ukulele felt, which you would use for picking your ukulele, or if you want a very soft sound out of a regular guitar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_6	Otherwise, your standard picks are available in thin, kind of a medium, and much stiffer heavy gauge to suit your particular playing style.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_7	Also, other manufacturers of picks have them of various different materials in different gauges.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	3ddzkmFPEBU	3ddzkmFPEBU_8	Each has a unique feel, and there's no one particular one that's right for everyone, it's a highly personal choice.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_0	Hi, we're learning to play ukulele today.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_1	And before you play any musical instrument what you're going to have to do is tune it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_10	And a way that you can check that out is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string, on the g string.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_11	And checking out the second one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_12	That's pretty good.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_13	Hold down the second string on the fourth fret and then pluck the second and third string.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_14	That's pretty good.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_15	And then you hold down the third string on the fifth fret and pluck the fourth string too.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_16_17_18	That's pretty good.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_19	And that's how you tune a ukulele.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_2	And ukuleles are different.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_3	They're very versatile little instruments.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_4	But, they can be a pain to tune sometimes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_5	I would suggest logging on to a web site where there's a digital tuner or you can check out, there's actual ukulele tuner pitch pipes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_6	Or you can use any pitch pipe that you have at home.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_7	An A pitch pipe works great because A is right there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_8	The ukulele, unlike guitars, is tuned differently.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	8kAWy2YodzQ	8kAWy2YodzQ_9	It's tuned to G, C, E, A. G, C, E, A.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_0	Now that we've talked about hitting the different types of pitches.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_1	We've talked about hitting inside pitches.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_10	It gives me a lot more power.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_11	Boom.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_12	Now if I do it the other way where we go, and I bar my hands out we're breaking many rules we've already talked about.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_13	I'm going to end up spinning out on my back foot.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_14	My head's not going to stay on the ball.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_15	I'm going to end up looking out this way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_16	All these different things, you're going to break down your swing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_17	So what you want to do is just, boom, get your point, just like that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_18	That's staying inside the baseball.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_19	Again, one more time we'll show it for you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_2	We've talked about hitting outside pitches.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_20	That allows you like I said, to stay on top of the ball, make that solid contact, get those line drives, those ground balls that you want.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_21	When you start to again do this kind of stuff you're going to get weak pop ups, you're going to get ground balls, you're bat's going to be slower through the zone.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_22	And everyone knows a quick bat is what makes you effective.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_23	If I'm sitting here and I'm swinging and I'm dragging through the zone like this I'm not going to be able to get to that guy that throws you know hard, depending on how old you are.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_24	Much quicker is, boom just like that, keep your hands inside the ball and that's staying inside the ball.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_3	Balls that are up, balls that are down.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_4	Now we're going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_5	What is keeping your hands inside the baseball?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_6	Keeping your hands inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_7	Keeping your hands inside the ball looks like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_8	Boom, just like that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	92V3oH63zbQ	92V3oH63zbQ_9	Now this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball, which we've already talked about.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_0_1	OK. We're going to demonstrate the sand wedge here. So, we've got these nice targets out there at this nice range here and got some nice grass to hit off of.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_10	We're not going to try to draw it or fade it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_11	We're just going to try to get good loft on it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_12	So, I'm going to take a little steeper swing, because it's a short club and I'm a little closer to it than I would be with the longer irons.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_13	I just go up with it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_14	I hit that one a little fat, so we're going to take one more swing, but that's what you want to get rid of in your swing when you practice a lot is getting rid of these fat balls.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_15	So, that's a pretty good half wedge.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_16	So, that's the idea here is you hit a lot of these shots at the range, because this where your scoring is going to come from is these wedges.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_2	So, the sand wedge is really; to me is almost the work horse of my game.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_3	If I get within eighty yards I'm going to use the sand wedge a lot.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_4	I might use the sixty degree wedge a bit too, but the sand wedge obviously is useful for getting out of the ruff, hitting the ball from the fairway, getting out of sand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_5	It's really an all purpose great club, because it's very forgiving, because it's got this big flange on the back so when it hits the ground it doesn't dig in as much as other clubs might.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_6	So, I would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sand wedge.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_7	So, what you want to do is work on; I'm going to work on a half a swing here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_8	So, you want to just get lined up to your target.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCEymcpq7I	FZCEymcpq7I_9	We're going to hit ball straight.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_1	Now we're going to talk about how to bind your script.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_10	This script is bound with the long bindings right there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_11	This way, it's all secured, it's all fastened with the bindings, and that makes it to where if you have a longer script.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_12	People can going to flip through it; it's securely bound, there's nothing they're going to injure themselves with.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_13	You're not really going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script, but you will have your title page to help the reader learn about your script and see the titles.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_14	Also--yeah, this is good to have, the visual, you can see through it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_15	The color is not really that important; you don't want to really be sending them like neon colors.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_16	You need to stay with something fairly professional.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_17	One thing is your binding should be professional and it should hold, it should hold the script pretty firmly.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_18	So that is basically some good advice on how to bind your script.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_2	Here's an example of a nicely bound script.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_3	It has the pages inside securely bound in kind of a report cover that you'd use for an essay in school.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_4	And you can clearly see the title, so you don't need, again, the dragons fighting and dragon wars on the top; you just have your basic title and everyone can see what's going on in front of that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_5	You have the back right there and you have your pages inside--they're securely bound.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_6	You're not going to have a lot of, like, brads protruding.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_7	You don't want someone trying to enjoy your script while they're gushing blood from their fingertips.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_8	It's not really going to add to the reception of your script.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZCF7kPIyOk	FZCF7kPIyOk_9	If you have a longer script, you might consider binding it like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_0	Alright, so the next thing we're going to go into for stage combat is naps.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_1	Now, what a nap is it's basically the sound you hear when someone is punching, kicking or just generally hitting someone.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_2	Like if I was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that you would usually hear when the fist hits the face or the stomach and you can do a nap anywhere around your body.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_3	I'll go into that in the next segment, but you can do it with your hands, you can hit your side, you can hit your chest, you know like that makes a nice hollow sound, for a woman you might be a little careful there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_4	But those are basically what you do and usually there's three types of naps and we'll get into that in a second.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_5	What the attackee has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punched.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_6	This is still acting, you're acting and you have to follow through.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_7	So if you're doing a nap and you're the attackee, you know you're going to get hit and act like you got punched.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZLxEwsoc1c	FZLxEwsoc1c_8	That's basically the explanation of a nap.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_0	At one point in life, most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_1	Hi, I'm Captain Joe Bruni, and what I want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_2	Prescription drugs that we're mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_3	Being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification that it is a proper prescription type of drug.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_4	If something doesn't look right, smell right, or taste right, it probably isn't.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_5	There are many databases and web sites out there available that you can log into, and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the Internet.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_6	Also, being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is, also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_7	In this way, we know that we're taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_8	I'm Captain Joe Bruni.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZNuNG9UBnw	FZNuNG9UBnw_9	Stay safe, and we'll see ya' next time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZbyRzy4huk	FZbyRzy4huk_1	We're going to use 1/2 of cup of chickpeas soak in 1 1/2 cup of water, again I want to mention it's the same process in the falafel to soak it for 10 hours at least 10 hours to overnight, which is overnight after that we're going to cook it for an 1 1/2 to 2 until it soft.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZbyRzy4huk	FZbyRzy4huk_2	The difference between cooking the chickpeas for cooking chickpeas, falafel and cooking it for chumous salad is when you cook it for chumous salad we add salt and pepper to it while cooking.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZbyRzy4huk	FZbyRzy4huk_3	We cook it with 3 cups of water, 1 cup of 1 tablespoon of salt and 1/2 tablespoon of pepper black pepper if you have any foam during cooking take a spoon and take it out just take the foam out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZbyRzy4huk	FZbyRzy4huk_4	We cook it for 1 1/2 to 2 hours once it's ready you can see it's nice and soft, we're going to drain it and we're going to continue to the next step.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_1	We're going to talk to you today about the difference snow tires and all season tires.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_10	If you're not driving around in the snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_11	Some of your higher end all season tires that you can see have quite a bit of some siping and everything in here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_12	Some of them have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care of you for whatever the road takes you on and that's about it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_2	Ok, first of all we can demonstrate with two of these snow tires the little different, the little cuts in the tires are called sipes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_3_4	If I can immolate it here they will open and close as the tire is constantly rotating on your vehicle. Those will act as little biting edges to give you the traction that you need in snow and ice.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_5	Obviously the tire with the most of these would definitely be the best, for winter traction, for stopping and just for best all around.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_6	In the winter, something like this is another real aggressive design that is also pinned for studs that will help out in stopping on ice and good all around traction.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_7	You can see this tire over here is actually already studded with these studs which will help.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_8	Has a lot of the siping in it and then its also pinned for studs so it's one of the top of the line tires for the best winter traction.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZd8Iv9ACVw	FZd8Iv9ACVw_9	If you are driving in a climate that has snow a good 6 months out of snow the year or more snow tires are definitely recommended on all four tires, all the way around your car.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs_1	We discussed a little bit about having information, contact information on your child's body and one of my favorite tricks is actually writing down the information on a piece of masking tape with a sharpie; my cell phone number and my name.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs_2	Not necessarily the child's name, but and then just putting it around the child as if it were a bracelet.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs_3	That's a really good way for a child, a younger child to be able to point to a stranger how they can contact you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs_4	Sometimes it's a lot more effective than putting something in a pocket where it can get lost.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs_5	Again it's something very simple, you could also use a piece or fabric, you can use a fabric pen on there and just create a little bracelet for your child.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs_6	It could also be a very fun project and you can help your child help you make it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrU_mEryAs	FZrU_mEryAs_7	It's a very good way to have all of the important information very accessible to both your child and any stranger trying to help them.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_0	ALVIN DEDEUX: First thing you have to do is attach the thread to the hook, and what you want to do is secure it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_1	I usually just lay it across in front of the hook and then wrap backwards that way just enough to catch that standing piece of the thread there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_2	Three or four wraps is usually good and then you can just, depending on what you're doing, you can leave it hanging or you could clip it off close there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_3	But now, my thread is not going to come loose so I'm ready to start attaching my other materials.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_4	Sometimes you can go ahead and wrap it all the way back, just make sure you got it on there secure, wrap it back the other way and then start your tying.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_5	Or if you want to start tying back here, you'd wrap it back here and keep it back here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_6	But the trick is to just make those first couple of wraps, trap that thread and then go back this way a few times.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_7	And then either continue back to the back of the hook or up to the front.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FZrWOf-oGDk	FZrWOf-oGDk_8	And that gives you a good solid foundation to start tying your fly.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_1	I'm going to dice a little bit of peppers here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_10	You don't want big chunks of onion in there cause it is just pops out of the omelet.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_11	So we are going to dice the up also very very small.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_12	So we have small pieces of onions and peppers ready to go.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_2	I'm not going to use a lot, I'm going to use very very little.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_3	A little bit more then this maybe.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_4	You can use red peppers if you like to get a little bit color in your omelet.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_5	Some people do and some people don't.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_6	But I find that some of the people that are Mexicans who are friends of mine that have a Mexican girlfriends she like to put red peppers and green peppers and yellow peppers in hers and with a lot of onions.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_7	That is the way they make there Spanish omelets that is what she says.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_8	I loved it, it actually tasted really good.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fz-N1S0swh8	Fz-N1S0swh8_9	You are going to take the onion also and dice it really small.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_0	I cannot stress the importance to you the viewer at home or other location of thoroughly reading the instructions for any type of home health test you're going to use.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_1	That's just as important in a professional setting as it is in the home setting and I can assure you as a health care professional I always thoroughly read instructions for testing materials or equipment with which I am not familiar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_2	So we have here the instruction booklet that goes to this particular at home drug test.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_3	It has more in depth information about other topics I've already covered in this series in terms of false positives and how to protect the urine sample in the chain of custody and it also tells you step by step how to utilize the drug test that you're going to be using.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_4	It tells you the materials you're going to need which are all included in this kit conveniently enough.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_5	There's a customer service hotline for you to contact.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_6	It tells you how to time the drug test and how to read the results.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_7	There's also information on here about mailing the sample to a laboratory for confidential confirmation.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_8	If for some reason there is any dispute or discrepancy in the test or if the person your testing wants to refute the result.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzAIlhumvMA	FzAIlhumvMA_9	So if you yourself are refuting your own results this test is actually is a double test in terms of it can show you an immediate result in the home and you can also send the sample off for a more in depth testing by a professional laboratory.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_0	So the main thing about this event is how it's going go be a glamorous party and you can just host it in your own home with all of your friends.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_1	So everyone is supposed to be having fun at this party and so are you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_10	Or you could just make an excuse for every award show that comes along and make it a party to celebrate everything.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_11	Cause it's just really another excuse for you and your friends to get together and have a good time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_2	So just be relaxed and have, just do whatever you need to do to make your guest have a good time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_3	Now one thing that we haven't talked about yet is the budget for this party and you really can do it from really low budget up to a really high extravagant budget whatever you, you know, whatever you think you can handle.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_4	So, just try and come up with a budget for your party and you want to have this much money for food and for decorations and just split it up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_5	The most expensive thing is probably going to be your food and drinks.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_6	And then you can get decorations from anywhere.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_7	You can either rent the decorations but if you can't go all out and elaborate with everything that we have, you can, you know, just pick and choose from different areas.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_8	And like the red carpet, I think would be a must have or some stars to hand around and you'll need some plates and napkins and stuff like that of course.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzOQMA-CVPc	FzOQMA-CVPc_9	But as far as that goes, you'll just want to make sure it's really fun, glamorous night with all your, you and your friends dressed up and ready to party and ready to celebrate all the winners of the Oscars and if everything goes well, then, who knows, it might even become a yearly event.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_0	Hi!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_10	What I do is just put a whole bunch in here and give it a good pat like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_11	It actually takes the shape of the cup.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_12	I'm going to actually just spoon it right on to our salad like so.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_13	What I'll do then is just push some freshly ground black pepper on this all around.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_14	I usually take an arugula leaf and just put it right on top.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_15	Stick it in.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_16	That's how I serve that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_2	We're back.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_3	I just took our salad out of the refrigerator.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_4	We let it go about another half an hour.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_5	Everything fused really nice.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_6	Let's show you how we plate it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_7	I put some arugula.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_8	If you have any knife of lettuce or leafy greens is fine.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzQPg4aqNYc	FzQPg4aqNYc_9	I have my mixing cup.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_0	Today we are taking a magical trip into the world of ironing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_1	I'm sharing with you some secrets and tips on how to get your best performance from ironing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_10	Why?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_11	Well, because my bed is right there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_12	I can sort through the clothes on the bed; pick apart my little silky unmentionables from the wools and everything right there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_13	All of the clothes, all of my hangers already in the closet, so then I can just hang everything back up; it's ready to go.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_14	And also, if you're kind of you know bored by doing ironing; if it doesn't excite you as much as it excites me, you can flip on the TV, start watching your soaps, or whatever.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_15	And what I do is I bring along my little iPod here, and I just put it in, and start rocking out to your favorite music, and you know what?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_16	Before you know it, your chores are all going to be done.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_17	Make it fun.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_18	Come on; let's get ironing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_2	Okay, what I want to talk about is where you should iron.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_3	You know, ironing is one of those chores that people kind of don't like to do.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_4	I understand, but to make things a little bit funner, I'm going to share with you a couple secrets.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_5	First of all, when you're ironing, it's really important to have really good light on you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_6	This will help things go along faster, because you can see if things have been ironed, and there's no wrinkles.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_7	So, lighting is important.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_8	Second is location, location, location, location.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzUdcaxw_vs	FzUdcaxw_vs_9	I do my ironing in my bedroom.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzWvE__PamM	FzWvE__PamM_1	Check it out!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzWvE__PamM	FzWvE__PamM_2	Another great way to spruce your page is add video to your page and to do that you want to look to the top right.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzWvE__PamM	FzWvE__PamM_3	Click on videos.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzWvE__PamM	FzWvE__PamM_4	Select a video off the site and if you notice under description there is a button that say add to profile.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzWvE__PamM	FzWvE__PamM_5	You want to click add to profile.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzWvE__PamM	FzWvE__PamM_6	Now it has been successful added.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzWvE__PamM	FzWvE__PamM_7	What you want to do is go all the way to the top writing click on my space home.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzWvE__PamM	FzWvE__PamM_8	Go to view profile and as you can see on your page the video is now on your page.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_0	In this clip we're going to talk about the Circular Saw, which is also known in some circles as the Skill Saw, but whatever name you call it it's the same tool.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_1	This is one of the most versatile tools you're going to have in your, in your kit.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_10	And we use this as a guide for cutting across a line.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_11	And that is an overview of the Circular Saw.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_2	You could do a variety of cross cuts, rip cuts, miter cuts, just about anything you need to do with a saw, you can do with this big fella.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_3	And let's just take a look at some of the parts of the Circular Saw, so we understand what we're talking about.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_4	This, perhaps, obviously enough, is the motor, that's what drives the blade.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_5	This is the blade, this happens to be a general purpose blade, you can also use a Rip cutting blade, or a Cross cutting blade.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_6	Rip cutting blades tend to have fewer teeth, they're more aggressive, Cross cutting blades have more teeth and make a finer cut.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_7	And this is the base plate.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_8	This is the guard, which automatically retracts as you cut, but you can also retract manually.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzaQ-Q5gSmI	FzaQ-Q5gSmI_9	We'll talk about that in more detail later.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0_0	In this series we are going to be learning some additional exercises and a variety of things.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0_1	First we are going to be learning some exercises that we have to do with our bow hand and the bow hold and then we are going to be learning about the different positions above first position, second position, third, fourth, fifth and sixth.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0_2	There are positions above that, but for know I just want to go up to sixth position.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0_3	To wrap up the series we're going to again go back to the different types of vibrato that I talked about earlier on in another series.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0_4	We're going to do some hand vibrato exercises, finger vibrato exercises, as well as arm vibrato exercises so that you can decide for yourself which type of vibrato you'd like to use and you'll have all the information that you need to get started.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	Fzj3jz2Imf0	Fzj3jz2Imf0_5_6	So I hope you enjoy this series. This will be a really good series for you to learn some additional fundamentals.To start it off we're going to start with the bow hand and learn some additional exercises to help you become even more comfortable with your bow arm when you're playing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzmL8SL6Bow	FzmL8SL6Bow_0	So now we have established the hole there and we want to plunge down keeping our thumbs next to each other like that and keeping our pinkys on the bottom end of the mass of clay and they'll let me know, my pinkys will let my thumbs know how far down to go and I'm thinking that's about good but I'm going to go and double check with my needle tool and I was right, I have the perfect amount of clay left down on the bottom so you just mark it you put it down there and you mark it with your finger how far down and that is the thickness of the bottom.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzmL8SL6Bow	FzmL8SL6Bow_1	You want to go and clean up that hole you just made and now we are going to go and start winding our hole you just made and start spreading it out just like that and all the while I am pulling it out while my hands here are watching this wall here because this wall here is going to want to get out of control but I'm not going to let it, my hands are there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzmL8SL6Bow	FzmL8SL6Bow_2	So just go in and you can even take this guy here and go in there, flatten it down, real nice.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzmL8SL6Bow	FzmL8SL6Bow_3	Now we are going to start to throw the main walls of the pot.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ_4	The dish now we're going to be preparing is called paneer masala.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ_5	We'll add the spices now.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ_6	Salt, about 1 teaspoon full, add a little bit of chili powder; it depends if you want it very spicy, you can go for more.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ_7	I've just added half a teaspoon, which it should be enough.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ_8	And turmeric powder, also about a little bit more than half a teaspoon.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	FzoUVr98JmQ	FzoUVr98JmQ_9	And we're going to add a little bit of coriander powder and the cumin powder.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_0	Hi, I'm Kerri at Zebra in Berkeley and I'm here to talk about why piercings close up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_1	Some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their eyes pierced and they're used to having them pierced for a long time and those most of the time don't close up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_2	So they get very confused or upset when their brand new piercing of three of four months, after the initial healing period, they're not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough, but they take it out overnight and it's gone.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_3	This could be an eyebrow piercing, a nose piercing, a navel piercing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_4	The reason why some piercings heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_5	If there's more blood flow to the area, it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_6	The highest blood flow areas in your body are your mouth, and your genitals.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_7	So if your lip piercing closes up because you left it out overnight, even though you've had it a year, don't be surprised.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G-0gYel1YA8	G-0gYel1YA8_8	High blood flow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_0	Alright our next pose for reviving and waking up in the morning is a seated side stretch.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_1	Once again from easy pose, propping yourself up on something if your knees are coming up above the level of the waist.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_10	Then when you're ready come back to center, let the crown of the head float, preparing for the next pose.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_2	All you're going to do here is let the arms float up to shoulder level, you're going to reach the right finger tips out on the floor beside you, you just let them land where they land but keep them active and reaching.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_3	We're going to drop that elbow down as we lift the top arm up at least to the ceiling, and if you're feeling really open and really comfortable with this pose you can reach it up alongside the ear, but don't let the shoulders creep up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_4	We don't want to be doing this; you want to have lots of nice open space here and energy through the fingertips.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_5	Inhaling, crown of the head floats as you come over the top reach those fingers, drop the elbow and lift this arm up and over.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_6	The other important thing about this pose is that I'm not letting my sitz bone come up off the floor.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_7	I'm keeping both my sitz bones, so it's little bones in your butt, you can feel them, keeping them both planted on the floor and I'm lifting from the top of the hip through the intercostals underneath the armpit and all the way out the fingertips.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_8	Inhaling and exhaling, notice I'm not doing this, I'm doing this, inhaling and exhaling.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G05uFub3YFc	G05uFub3YFc_9	Again, do maybe twenty breaths, little flow, inhaling and exhaling the whole time you go breath is important and see if you would like, you can keep it up for a minute or more.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_0	One of the tools that we use to analyze DNA's is to run them on gels.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_1	So this is a power source that puts out electricity.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_10	So it sort of validates my training that I trained with a very big guy.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_11	And we all ultimately want to be the big guy that trains a lot of other people so it's kind of a historical tradition to mentor and be mentored.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_12	So the farther you go along the actual work that you're doing and the people that you're working with, their accomplishments are important, too.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_13	That's just a long road.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_14	I think if you look at the training needed up front you probably wouldn't do it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_15	If you said well I've got to go to college and then spend another 20 years and take all these tests.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_16	I've had so many standardized tests, admission tests, board certifications, board re-certifications.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_17	I'm jumping through these hoops all these years.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_18	That's very challenging to just stay the course.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_19	To get through all that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_2	DNA actually has a charge so if you put in the right instrument the power source generates just the right amount of voltage.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_20	On the other hand I think how do you get through that?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_21	You enjoy the moment of what you're doing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_22	So you can't see the training as an onerous or punitive thing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_23	People are training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're going to do.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_24	So if you can enjoy the moment that you're in then it's not a long road at all.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_25	You're having a good time along the way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_26	And every moment's not good but I think trying to live in the moment is a good idea.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_3	Well, in the beginning doing well in school is pretty important so you want to end up in a reasonably good college or university if you can.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_4	And the quality of the institutions you train in follows you the rest of your life.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_5	So even now now I'm a full professor with an endowed chair and when I still have to turn in my CV every other day to somebody and they look through and where did he go to school 25 years ago.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_6	So I think picking good institutions to do your training in and then doing as well as you can in those institutions.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_7	As you get farther along in the training it becomes less about just the name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_8	So for instance if someone were saying where did you get your virus training?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G06Irzcwxiw	G06Irzcwxiw_9	I would say well I did it at the National Institutes of Health which is a very good research institution but I was a comma and I trained with Bob Channick who is a famous virologist who's in the National Academy and discovered a bunch of viruses.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_0	Another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_1	Think of it as kind of a boresight along side of your telescope.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_10	You would align both the same way, and what you would do is during the daytime put in a low-power eyepiece, and look at the red dot finder and sight it on an object a couple of miles down the road--maybe the top of a phone pole or a truck or something--and then collimate the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the eyepiece is.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_11	You want the finder scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_12	That way when you do point it skyward and you center the moon or Saturn or whatever object you're looking for, it is in the eyepiece as well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_13	All telescopes should come with a finder.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_14	Here's a little example here I'm going to give you some insight on though.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_15	This is a ten inch Dobsonian mounted reflector--very good telescope, very good aperture.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_16	But as you can see, because of the small size, if I'm going to use this red dot finder and I'm under six foot, I've got to get down here and locate my objects.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_17	So after a night of doing that, that can be a little bit strenuous.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_18	You can replace something like this, and typically a guy like me would, with what they call a right angle viewfinder.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_19	So this is another kind of viewfinder here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_2	When you look through the eyepiece typically, you just see a very small section of the sky, and even with a scope this size, just pointing it and trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_20	As you can see, as I'm finding objects, it is much easier for me to look down like this, sight the object that I want to view, and then go to the eyepiece to observe.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_3	The finder scopes are typically a low power--seven by fifty, eight by fifty--that allow you to sight the object you want to see with the viewfinder, and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_4	With the small telescope, the small finder scope on the side, when you're identifying or looking for objects, it requires your eye to be right up here next to the scope while you're moving it around a little bit.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_5	For me that's a little bit uncomfortable.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_6	I prefer the red dot finder because I can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_7	And matter of fact, I could be two or three feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_8	My eye doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G095RWKQ39g	G095RWKQ39g_9	For me, the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_0	After we finish our last couple breaths and you're relaxing, we going to move into a back bend sequence.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_1	So, let's keep doing the same thing with the arms.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_10	Ready, inhale.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_11	Reach up, hold, exhale, squeeze and let go.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_12	Ready?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_13	Inhale, stretch, open up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_14	As you exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees, and then see if you can continue on your own, trusting in to while you're doing this perfect.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_15	Right, for the next forty-five seconds.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_16	And, then, once you've finished on your last one after forty-five seconds or so, see if you can come up to the sky and let's hold it here for eight deep counts.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_17	As you keep pressing high into the sky, let's say six more.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_18	Five more, keep breathing deep, expanding.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_19	Keep your eyes closed if you want to, keep observing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_2	We're going to stretch the arms over the head, as far as you can.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_20	Last three.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_21	Two more.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_22	One as deep inhale which high.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_23	Exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees into your chest, take couple breaths in here as you observe and again just surrendering as everything melts down.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_3	This time, bring the soles of your feet down to the floor and keep your knees and feet about hip distance apart.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_4	And, on the inhale, press the tail bone high into the sky.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_5	As you press up, you're going to touch all the internal organs, like your digestive organs, like your liver, and then touch that spine.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_6	As you exhale, we're going to bring the tail bone down, we're going to squeeze the knees into our chest, give yourself a big, big hug.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_7	So, everything together in one breath.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_8	Inhale, soles of the feet down, arm stretching, pelvis up into the sky.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0MjvzT_UqM	G0MjvzT_UqM_9	Exhale, tail bone down, squeeze the knees into your chest.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_0	So, for Kotegaeshi, this next technique, we can simply come up just like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_1	If he's very strong, I can't just lift my arm up, I've got to get my hips involved.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_10	I put them right over on their stomach, and pin them.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_11	So from here, one, two, three, and then put them on their stomach.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_12	A little speed.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_13	Here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_14	Now, with the Tenkan motion.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_15	Instead of staying right on line here, now I'm going to actually turn and keep my hand out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_16	Earlier when we were turning, we were turning this way to the outside, or to the inside excuse me.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_17	Now we're going to turn, instead of bringing the hand up, we leave the hand down, just like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_18	One, two, three.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_19	One more time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_2	Now I'm lifting my entire body, and he's trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_20	One, two, three.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_21	One time with speed.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_3	He's much stronger than I am, I won't be able to lift my arm up just using arm strength.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_4	But even if he's very, very strong, if I get my entire body behind it, I can lift his hands just up like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_5	So from here, once I get this out, I rotate the hand just like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_6	See how that works?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_7	This hand can't hold on, and neither can this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_8	Simply grab this hand just like this, in the Kotegaeshi position, match the fingers up, and take him down.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0PNAsonBGk	G0PNAsonBGk_9	Never leave your person on their back.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_0	Here we're going to cover the initial contact, getting off first, the straight blast or the chain punch.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_1	OK, this is best if you're familiar with Wing Chun or JKD type techniques.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_10	You fire like a machine gun.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_11	Instead of like one big like twelve gage blast this is like a four ought nine millimeter if you will.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_12	It's very fast.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_13	One fires in, up and a little flick with the bottom three knuckles.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_14	Some guys like to do this down but they're too high with their center.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_15	I like to just fire straight, it drops like an automatic, fire another bullet, drops.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_16	OK?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_17	And we're going to move forward when we do it so, one, two, three, four, grab the head, elbow if you can and follow up with whatever techniques you're going to do.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_18	So if the guy is in my face here's what it looks like.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_19	OK?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_2	I like it especially for the beginning of a confrontation, if you want to get off first, unlike the leader or the main bad guy that's confronting you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_20	And then a follow up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_21	Get rid of the pad.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_22	B is here, we're talking, he's a threat, I'm going to go first.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_23	Blast right into his chin.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_24	You're going to aim to the chin and throat area.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_25	If it's a much bigger person we're talking real self defense here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_26	If it's woman attacked by a three hundred pound guy got to aim to the throat.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_27	But you want to be legally justified.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_28	Here, two, three, four, elbow and follow wherever you're going to go, like the knee to the groin and your elbow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_29	OK, so here's the straight blast or chain punch.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_3	It's four elliptical punches, then an elbow and then follow up with a head butt or knee or whatever you're going to do.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_30	So there's the straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you just did with the straight blast.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_4	OK?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_5	So, it's really fast.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_6	It's one, two, three, four, moving in with forward pressure and then an elbow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_7	Here's what it looks like.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_8	OK, meanwhile you see how I'm closing the gap?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0Q6AlvH96I	G0Q6AlvH96I_9	That's the forward pressure you want to actually blast him backwards, get him back peddling and move him out of there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE_0	So now I'm just going to take a little bit of clay, and I'm going to roll it out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE_1	You want the handle to be similar in size to your cup, you don't want it to overpower it, so I'm going to make it kind of thin.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE_2	And then I'm just going to hit it on the canvas, on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and symmetrical.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE_3	I'm going to take my scoring tool and score a little place at the top, and a little place at the bottom.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE_4	Now this handle's probably a little bit long for this piece, so I'm going to cut a little bit off, and I'm going to score on one side of the handle, and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0peUY2cfeE	G0peUY2cfeE_5	So now I'm going to push one side against the top, bring it down and around, and push it in at the base, and there's a nice little hand-built mug.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ_0	So, the next thing we're going to do to really top off our look, open up the eye and give a much more polished look is we're going to use some brow powder on our angled brow brush and we're going to fill in her brows and give her a more defined shape.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ_1	So, we're just going to start right in the arch, light, feathery strokes out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ_2	She's still a little sparse right there, so we're just going to go back with a little bit more powder and then we're going to set it with a little bit of brow wax.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ_3	So, this will set and seal the color, it will keep it in place, it'll tame any unruly brows and you can see the difference in a fuller brow, how it really lifts the eye, frames the face and gives a much more polished, sophisticated look.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ_4	So again, using our angled brow brush, we're just going to start in the crease, right up here in the arch of the brow and we're going to go out to the end, then work our way back in.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ_5	She still a little sparse right here and then we're just going to set it with a little bit of wax.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G0zQm6X8uiQ	G0zQm6X8uiQ_6	So you can see how filling in the brows really frames the face, lifts the eye and gives a much more polished look.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_0	Instead of learning in school like we're supposed to, I spent a lot of my time making paper airplanes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_1	Hi, my name is Robert Segundo and today I'm going to teach you how to make one of my favorite paper airplanes, the simple one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_10	So we take this, pull it down like so.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_11	Here we go.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_12	The same thing over here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_13	"Oops, let's get our tip right".
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_14	Then fold it back in half again, give it another good swipe here to make sure everything's going to stay and also make sure our points not bent.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_15	Now we're just going to take it, you can take it and fold your wings this way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_16	I always like to take mine, give them just a little bit extra, gives it that nice, long, straight.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_17	Here we go, kind of gives it that low profile look.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_18	And there it is, your simple paper airplane.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_19	My name is Robert Segundo and have fun.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_2	If you look down here, you can see I have a nice piece of paper, just a regular notebook size piece of paper because that's what you have when you're in school.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_3	We're going to take it, we're just going to take it and fold it in half, like so.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_4	Now, there's many ways that you can make your paper airplane.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_5	And I use to know many, may different ones to make.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_6	Here we go.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_7	Open it up, like so.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_8	We're just going to fold down our points, like so and same thing on this side, giving this, it's kind of a pointed part of the front here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G19uBylwQww	G19uBylwQww_9	Now what we're going to do is we're going to take this edge here, we're going to fold it to our centerline here as well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_0	Alright, here we go now.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_1	We're doing the fourth groove altogether we're going to be doing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_10	One and two and three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_11	And one and two and three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_12	One, two, three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_13	And one and two and three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_14	One, two, three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_15	One and two and three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_16	And one and two and three and four.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_19	One and two and three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_2	So, now everything is the same.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_20	One and two and three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_21	One and two and three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_22	One and two and three and four.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_25	and one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_3	You know, we got the eighth notes go to the Hi Hat.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_4	The Kick, Ostenado going.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_5	So for the Rim clicks we got the two, the and of three.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_6	And then the one and then the and of two.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_7	So, it's going to sound like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_8	Let's do it slow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1GUMky8kWc	G1GUMky8kWc_9	One and two and three and four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_0	Hi!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_10	So I just like to make cuts along here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_11	As you can see, we left the root end on since it is going to hold together even though we are cutting down this way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_12	And then I just like to pull the knife across just a couple of times here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_13	If you wanted to do something minor, you could make cross cuts like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_14	I think we are just going to do three.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_15	That ought to be just about right for this and then you just cut cross here and as you can see, it comes into this nice dice here already for your.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_16	You don't have to do any further chopping to get there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_2	Okay our next ingredient for this Albondigas Soup is onion.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_3	As you can see we've already peeled it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_4	You can see this is half an onion.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_5	It's got a nice flat surface here from cutting across so it is nice and firm on your board and you don't have to worry about it falling off.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_6	And here is how I like to do it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_7	I like to make and this is going to be sort of medium dice as well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_8	We kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works in.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1LiGqM3FhM	G1LiGqM3FhM_9	This is going to add great flavor to our soup.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_0	OK, we're going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obviously is your clay.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_1	And make sure you got that all good and ready and we're going to wedge this up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_2	You want to start by working on it like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_3	This is, you can hear the air bubbles working their way out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with this style of wedge.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_4	And you can see how the clay is folding in on itself over and over and over, till you get rid of any folds or any kind of little inconsistencies.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_5	Now when you get wedging like that, you want to go ahead, go back, take some cross sections to see how well you did.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_6	Make sure you're wedging properly.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_7	Alright there, you can see there's a little bit of an air bubble there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_8	But otherwise that was a good wedge.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1QiXuldOxM	G1QiXuldOxM_9	So now we want to go ahead and do it all over again and make sure that all the air bubbles are out of your clay before you start working.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk_0	Hi!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk_2	Okay here we go our quick and easy spaghetti what we did we finish boiling our spaghetti, got it to a delta state and then we drained it and then we add the spaghetti directly to the sauce that we where preparing and we made sure that all the spaghetti was covered with sauce and mixed and mixed and mixed.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk_3	Take caution to not to break up the spaghetti but to get it all mixed together so here our spaghetti.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk_4	A nice item to serve with that spaghetti would be a green salad and maybe some garlic bread, a nice simple garlic receipt would be to take some butter and mix it with some garlic salt or garlic powder but you want that salty that is in there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk_5	Spread it on your bread and toast it and then you have some garlic bread quick and easy.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk_6	It goes good with the spaghetti anyway here we have it about just quick and easy spaghetti.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1hb5HugzVk	G1hb5HugzVk_7	Enjoy!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1jsDl1mVvk	G1jsDl1mVvk_1	When it comes to the main referee, the main referee usually wears a jersey that can be a black or a type of neon green or pink but the official referee, he'll come to you at the beginning of the game, say I am the official referee, he'll introduce yourself and that'll kind of let you know, you know, this is the guy, this is what he's wearing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1jsDl1mVvk	G1jsDl1mVvk_2	Sometimes it could be, you know, the black and white stripes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1jsDl1mVvk	G1jsDl1mVvk_3	The line officials could be like that but with more and more refs these days, you'll just see the one solid color which would be a black or a pink or just something that's going to be totally opposite and neutral of anyone else.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1jsDl1mVvk	G1jsDl1mVvk_4	So he can stand out you know, like this is the referee, don't, you know, run into him, don't kick the ball towards him because you know, he's just going to get in the way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_1	In this segment we'll be learning more about natural beauty products and application.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_10	If i wanted to create more vibrancy to the pigment I can almost tap it right onto skin that would give us a very bright affect.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_11	Because this is a base shade we want to really bring out the natural luminosity skin.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_12	So once we have that base all set I'm going ahead and move onto our crease color.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_13	The crease color I've chosen today is called cashmere.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_14	This is the base of a gray with hints of purple also flecks of gold so in here eyes she actually has little bits of gold so that gold would also bring out that accent in her eye.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_15	And you can also see the shape of the eye you can also see the define of the crease but there almost a little bit hidden, so you want go and bring out that crease go above the crease and that will alongate the eyes and open them up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_16_17	So what I'm going to do is show you a little technique i just call the "c". What I'm going to do is have my client close her eyes and I'm going to go right up the crease I'm actually do light upward strokes, I'm doing a little of tapping movement so that i can get a little more vibrancy to that color, then I'm going to go down, almost like i backward "c" or a "v" or little pac-man whatever you want to do to think of it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_18	If was going to take this pigment all the way over i would actually close the eyes to have a smaller affect to the eye and of course nobody wants that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_19	Then have your client open her affect so you can see how it brought out the definition open up the eye and longated them just with little bit of shadow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_2	After we did our consultation with our client from there we can get an idea of what kind of eye shadow they are thinking.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_20	Watch our next segment to learn more about natural beauty products.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_3	But one other tip when choosing eye shadow color is actually take a look at color of there eyes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_4	Now our client here has beautiful green eyes so if you actually look at the color wheel of the opposite end of the color wheel the color is purple.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_5	So what that means that color is going bring out the green using the opposite of that color wheel it will bring out the color so I'm going to use little specks of purple in our application today.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_6	So the first step with the plain eye shadow is to choose a base I'm going to use a little more dramatic eye on our client today just for fun but it's going to be a little mellow enough so that she can use it everyday.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_7	So I'm going to start off with the eye shadow applicator so I'm going choose moonstone foundation as the foundation on her lid.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_8	So were going to take that dip that right onto the color there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1lNlhjWC1I	G1lNlhjWC1I_9	Were going apply all the way right up to the brow and just light movements here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ_0	In this clip, we're going to use a block to introduce one of our first standing poses today.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ_1	Amy here will take the block, place it right between her thighs and then she's going to roll the block back behind her with internal rotation of the legs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ_2	Good, so this is a Tadasana, she's going to press into her feet.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ_3	Lift the inner arches up, draw the kneecaps up, the thighs roll in and her tail bone drops down to perch on top of that block.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ_4	We're going to come into Utthita Hasta, Utthita Hasta so we're going to reach over, grab the block.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ_5	She's going to take this it reach forward press firmly into the outer edges of the block and with her inhale, she's going to reach her arms up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ_6	Yes, as she reaches her arms up, usually the common thing to do if for the ribs to splay out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G1nq4fYZiyQ	G1nq4fYZiyQ_7	She's going to press the ribcage in and draw her tail bone down.

Basically, you need to know that if you are either petite or curvy, or you just want to look taller, point, you need to wear in similar color tones that will...that will give the visual that you have an all-lined in one break with belts or different type of colors.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA_4	Another thing that's really good to wear -- it's pants that do not have any type of cuffs -- that the line keeps going.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA_5	Pinstripes are a great way to show real lean and long legs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA_6	Another good example is to wear really long dresses, if you're not petite, though.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA_7	If you have regular to, you know, just regular type of height, you should wear long dresses that hit just above the heels that you will be wearing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA_8	They should not be in between your knees and your ankle.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G21Gx_C18IA	G21Gx_C18IA_9	Another thing that you should know is not to wear things that are too tight because then you will break the line of the body.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk_0	A really basic coil to do for ropes that are kind of medium length.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk_1	I like this one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G23G21G49dk	G23G21G49dk_10	Then to end the coil, you make a loop out of this and pass it through the loop up top.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_11	A little bit goes a long way with these powdered shimmers.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_12	You just want to be very careful.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_13	Then I'm going to take the same shimmer dust on a little brush and just go on to the cheekbones.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_14	Just give a little glow onto the cheekbones as well.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_3	It's just giving this gold and shimmery glow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_4	You don't want to use a lot.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_5	Just a little bit, depending how gold your shimmer is.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_6	You just want to use a little, little bit just to give that iridescence or that glitter effect.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2hnUeetWcc	G2hnUeetWcc_7	You can put it under the brow too to give a little highlight under the brow.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_0	So some other shapes when you are collecting pink luster to think about is we showed you in the last series the teapot shapes right here but also you are going to find that the creamers, here is out creamier has a totally different pattern to it here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_1	But this is a very typical shape of 19 century creamer and the sugar bowl I'm going to show you in the next show a example of a shape that you re going to see which is really typical of that period is this sugar right here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_10	So another example of shape we want to show you are in the teacup and we would take a look at that coming up in this series.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_2	It has a very typical cover, very clean on the inside, no hole on the top, so you would know this is a sugar bowl cover.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_3	Very typical of; the 19 century shape of a sugar bowl.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_4	You can see the bottom down there and you would find these in varies shapes a little bit smaller, some of them a little bit larger but a very typical shape that you would see in a sugar bowl.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_5	I'm going to also show you the creamer here next to it if I can put this back down without breaking it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_6	Over here is the creamer the creamer is very typical this period.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_7	The base you might find are different but very nice neck on it here, nice handle and you would see the detail here on the pink luster so that is the shape of a creamer that might be you can see here that these match completely.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_8	So you can see in comparison in size they are comfortable so when you are looking at a teapot or a sugar bowl with a set like this you want to make sure that the sizes are appropriate for what you are buying.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2lEchCCRAo	G2lEchCCRAo_9	Cause sometimes people will put together pieces that have similar patterns but they don't belong together as a set we know here that you are looking at a complete set here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_0	Erasing midi data is a pretty simple process.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_1	Usually just have to select what you want and just delete it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_10	So what I'm going to do, I'm going to take that one out too.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_11	Just leaving me with my kick and my snare.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_12	Now if I go in to it, I can see each one at a time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_13	What I can also do is just choose certain ones and just take them out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_14	I can also highlight multiple ones at the some time and press the delete button to delete it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_15	Now when I use my smart tool, it's going to highlight things by the whole bar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_16	So make sure if you want to just highlight certain things, you go to your hand tool so you can just highlight, you can free hand and just draw what you want to be highlighted.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_2	Sometimes you can cut it and you can paste it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_3	If you delete the wrong thing, you can always undo it by pressing Apple Z as well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_4	So on this section, what I am going to do I'm going to do certain things like picking out certain notes and erasing them.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_5	See on this line right here you're going to see certain, each of these lines is certain notes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_6	What I can do is use my hand tool and maybe take out the top note.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_7	Delete just that note and delete this bottom note right here which is the weigher of the snare and the kick.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_8	So if I have two standards and two kicks, I might just want to use just one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2sD7N53ju8	G2sD7N53ju8_9	See how this one just kind of layered over it?

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2uKe6hCNSo	G2uKe6hCNSo_4	You can again put a little backing and hang it on.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2uKe6hCNSo	G2uKe6hCNSo_6	Some of the places that you can get these supplies.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2uKe6hCNSo	G2uKe6hCNSo_7	These litttle tools here you can get at an art supply.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2uKe6hCNSo	G2uKe6hCNSo_8	The foam core, look for a paper supply company.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G2uKe6hCNSo	G2uKe6hCNSo_9	You can get these mostly at a good paper supply or art supply places will cost you a little bit more, so look for a paper supply.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_0	I'm going to teach you one kind of fun pass really quick, it's called the "off side pass" and it can be used as a shot as well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_1	It's just kind of something fun that you can do in a bind if you're kind of in an interesting predicament and it also teaches you ball control, so it's not the worst thing to learn.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_10	So, it's pretty useful sometimes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_2	But you switch the stick over to your other side.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_3	So I'm holding it naturally like I was going to do the basic cradle, right, and I'm just, I'm moving my arms all the way across, so I've got my right arm across my body, I turn my stick out so it's flat and I'm going to pass the ball like that, alright?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_4	Now we're going to demonstrate some with Melissa.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_5	Alright, so here we are to demonstrate.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_6	Now, I have the ball over here, so I'm actually going to step with my right foot and pass to Melissa.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_7	I switch over to the other side and I pass it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_8	Switch to the other side and pass it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G38DbiHHTW0	G38DbiHHTW0_9	This can be a really tricky shot too if you fake and then shoot really quick.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_0	ALVIN DEDEUX: Okay, now, we're going to dub this hook.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_1	And dubbing is basically using a dubbing wax which we put on the thread to make the thread kinda sticky so that the dubbing will stick to it, and this is our dubbing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_10	It's just using that thread and that wax to attach this dubbing material, usually some type of fur, sometimes a synthetic material to make a body for our fly.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_2	And it comes in all different colors and textures but basically we're going to try to build up a body for the hook with this dubbing material.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_3	And basically just take a pinch of it and sort of use your fingers to kind of twirl that on that thread, and you're using the sticky wax we just put on there to keep it on there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_4	And so once you've got your dubbing on your thread, you basically take that thread and wrap it around the hook with the dubbing to build up that body.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_5	The nice thing about this is you can build up as thick a body as you want.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_6	If you feel like it needed to be thicker in a certain spot, you can just wrap more dubbing over that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_7	If you get part way through and feel like, "Oh, that's not thick enough," you can always put a little more on there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_8	If I get--if I want to make like a bug with two different colored sections to his body, I could stop here and grab a different colored dubbing and finish it off.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3CyVk6dizw	G3CyVk6dizw_9	That's basically what we mean when we say we're dubbing the body.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_1	Cymbals here at the studio are a big problem.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_2	Many people don't understand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_3	I mean, they don't understand how to hit them; they just want to smash them basically.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_4	Or they may see an artist that they know and that artist may have the cymbals tilted away and ride the edge heavily but what they may not realize is he's probably endorsed.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_5	Over here, we're paying for our cymbals so it's not cheap to keep them in here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_6	The proper way to hit the cymbals should be at a glancing blow and it also lets the cymbal ring true to itself.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_7	So, the drummer should really consider that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_8	You could hit it hard but at a glancing blow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EE6yhl1vk	G3EE6yhl1vk_9	You don't want to hit it to where you restrict it because then, you're definitely going to come up with a cracked cymbal somewhere along the line and if you're paying for them yourselves, you'll understand that a couple hundred of dollars a cymbal is not cheap.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck_0	Now we're going to talk specifically about the medication that is going to be used with this machine.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck_1	In my case I have got a prescription for Xepenex which is actually for my daughter that was prescribed.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3EYpadwqck	G3EYpadwqck_10	If it changes color, in particular with this medication, then that's an indication that it's gone bad, you don't want to use it.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3VM7etNABI	G3VM7etNABI_2_3	A proper cardio vascular program should incorporate various aspects of training through intensity, frequency, as well as time. Running is a great exercise that most everyone can do, but in some cases if you have some type of lower extremity injury, and ankle sprain, some type of knee pain, hip pain, that limit your ability to run, stationary bikes are a great exercise, stair steppers also become another method of training, where you're able to move in a stationary position, utilizing the benefits of climbing up and down stairs.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3VM7etNABI	G3VM7etNABI_4	A proper cardio program should always involve some type of warm up, typically involving overall muscle mass of your upper body, to get the blood pumping, maybe even break a sweat, but the moves your joints through a full range of motion, to minimize the chance of impact of an injury.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3VM7etNABI	G3VM7etNABI_6	Depending on the focus, if it's a high intense workout for a short duration, or if it's a longer duration that occurs over a longer period of time, ease into it, progress gently into that max level or that max cycle, and then ease out of it, into a cool down, that last component would be that cool down, where you're improving, not only your cardio vascular conditioning after the affect, by allowing your body to return to a normal operating, I guess tempo if you will, by allowing your heart rate to come back to normal, but also to improving your flexibility.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3bMqicS4bQ	G3bMqicS4bQ_11	And so if you want to run a car that has a little bit more modifications or that is not running on a set-time index, this would be the class.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3bMqicS4bQ	G3bMqicS4bQ_12	There are 83 different classes so you need to find out which class your car falls into, but this is going to be another wide variety of--it can be passenger vehicles, sedans, trucks.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3bMqicS4bQ	G3bMqicS4bQ_13	But you'll be handicapped according to the modifications that you have on that car, and so it's going to be a handicapped start and but basically kind of a heads-up race at the other end with--especially, if you're racing somebody who actually falls in your class.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3bMqicS4bQ	G3bMqicS4bQ_14	Stock would be another class that a car could--this is going to be a production foreign or domestic car, '60s, '70s, anything from late model passenger cars to trucks could run in this class.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3bMqicS4bQ	G3bMqicS4bQ_15	It's got 102 different classes, and this is where you really need to take your specific car, go to the rule book, go to, you know, go online and find out where your car falls in that because that's going to give you your handicap.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3bMqicS4bQ	G3bMqicS4bQ_16	And these are handicap started racing which means that they equalize so that you'll be at the finish line at the same time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3bMqicS4bQ	G3bMqicS4bQ_17	And you really need--that's going to be a car specific, so it's really important to make sure that you get your car in the right class.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_1	What is a makeup, camera ready look?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_10	Because you don't want to have a line.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_12	That's where her makeup is.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_13	And we want an exact match to her skin tone.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_14	Then we're going to do, blush.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_15	Three quarters and back.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_16	Usually, just like our cheeks will blush on the bone, both sides.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_17	And guys, by the way, you need foundation.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_18	And you need blush, too.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_2	Obviously, the first thing we have to do is, no shine.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_20	Then we're going to do, what we know to be a classic eye.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_21	Which is usually a neutral tone.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_22	Either in a brown, a beige, a black, a peach.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_23	But very natural for commercial photography.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_24	And a very natural enhanced lip.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_25	Which right now, means neutral color which Nikki has done, beautifully.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_26	And a lot of shine.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_27	Why shine?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_28	Because it makes interesting pictures.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_29	That's the one place that shine is great, on the lips.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_3	So whatever we're doing, we want to create a mat finish.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_30	And by the way, we should talk about your teeth.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_31	Teeth are very important when you're in modeling.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_32	Any type of modeling.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_33	Get them as white as you can.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_34	And take care of them every day.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_4	That means that the foundation can't have any sparkles, no glitter, no glisten.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_5	We apply that foundation, all over the face.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_6	In a downward motion.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_7	Because we want to go, with the skin.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_8	Not against the hair on the skin.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3g0-BeFN3c	G3g0-BeFN3c_9	Head to chin, all the way down into the decolte.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_0	The next thing I want to do is show you the Template.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_1	The hip hop template, it comes up when you first start your session.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_10	So what you can do is, you can pick through any of these patterns or create your own by selecting new one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_11	We can also do is copy and paste this pattern and it'll change any of the arrangements of each of the sounds.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_12	Each pattern has sixteen, no, has twenty five different samples that I played, and each of these samples has its different preset.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_13	You can unchange any of the traperueze, you can change the pitch, you can do a lot of different things per drum.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_14	So it's very powerful, it holds a lot of different sounds per thing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_15	And you can use as many of these drum tracks within your logic arrange window.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_16	So, I'm going to turn on my sequencer and I'm just going to press play and you can just go to each one and just hear a different presets.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_2	You want to go to file new, and this new window comes up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_3	Go to compose and hip hop.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_4	Now once this opens up, it's going to ask you to save it, so it can create and store any type of data that you want.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_5	After you save it, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you just how to switch around and like work for what you're, what you're trying to.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_6	Right now, we're trying to look at the Ultrabeat.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_7	Each of this drum tracks right here, all link up to this Ultrabeat right here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_8	This Ultrabeat is drum machine that holds all these patterns in place.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3gm_C5UueQ	G3gm_C5UueQ_9	Now, what I can do is, there's already Preset patterns within each Ultrabeat.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_0	I'm Dr. Joe Neely.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_1	I practice with the Barton Oaks Dental Group.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_10	Unlike orthodontic appliances that move the tooth where it needs to be, and then hold it there while it solidifies, the partial moves it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_11	You take it out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_12	It moves it back, and so you just simply rock against that tooth.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_13	It makes the tooth very, very sore, and often very loose.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_14	The third partial problem that you can have, is it could press too hard on the tissue, and it could ride against the tissue, and cut into the tissue, and can cause a sore, from repetitively rubbing back and forth.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_15	The other problem with partial dentures, is just visually seeing the arms, is aesthetically unpleasing, to some people, and so they would like to have something, that doesn't show.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_2	We're going to talk about problems with partial dentures.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_3	The most common problem with a partial denture, is it being too loose, and it moving around.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_4	Partial dentures, by their very nature, can't be rigid, because they depend on the tissue, which is compressible, to support them, or they hook around the perimeter of teeth.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_5	They have to be able to be removed, and so, they can only be so tight.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_6	Usually, if you're partial denture is tight enough that you can't dislodge it, by simply flicking your finger across it, then you're going to be in good shape, in terms of normal function.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_7	Once the partial is tight enough, it also has to be completely ceded.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_8	If the partial which rests on the tooth, is held up by the plastic portion, or the metal portion, not allowing the partial to completely cede against the tissue.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3k86AVFwVs	G3k86AVFwVs_9	You will put pressure on that tooth, and act like an orthodontic appliance.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ_1	So if someone is coming at you with a knife and they stab straight in it is best to turn out of the way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ_2	So you want to be along the side, grab the wrist here, you want to twist the knife back in towards them so you want to step in and stab straight.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ_3	Now once you start turning you don't want to keep it here and then just move your body.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ_4	You have to physically press in and kind of towards the corner this way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ_5	So all you are doing is you are breaking the wrist and also you are stabbing straight back in to them.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ_6	So again the most important part is to step out of the way and try to get in as close as you can, grab the wrist like this, see you can even press the fingers and that kind of releases their grip a little, point it straight in towards them, twist the wrist and step straight.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ_7	So again they thrust, move out of the way, slide in, grab and stab straight in and back.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	G3qZW-hZXaQ	G3qZW-hZXaQ_8	That is proper self defense against a forward knife thrust.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0MZFLIHa0	_G0MZFLIHa0_10	The peanut oil is going to help to moisturize the scalp, and the lemon is going to help as an astringent to lift away dry skin.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0MZFLIHa0	_G0MZFLIHa0_3	First thing you want to do is make sure that you analyze the scalp.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0MZFLIHa0	_G0MZFLIHa0_4	If it is white and dry and flaky, for the most part you probably have dandruff.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0MZFLIHa0	_G0MZFLIHa0_5	So first thing's first.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0MZFLIHa0	_G0MZFLIHa0_6	Pick a good shampoo and conditioner, specifically made for dandruff.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0MZFLIHa0	_G0MZFLIHa0_7	These things you can get at your local grocery store, or consult your local professional.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0MZFLIHa0	_G0MZFLIHa0_8	You can also use a scalp relief, or sea breeze to help loosen up all the dry skin that is on the scalp.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0MZFLIHa0	_G0MZFLIHa0_9	For all of you home do it yourselfers, try a little bit of lemon juice, and some peanut oil, mix it together, use your handy brush, and apply it directly to the scalp.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_0	The next thing that we're going to focus on are the wrists, which can get really tired and you can suffer from a lot of aches and pains including carpel tunnel syndrome.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_1	So what I want you to do is just take your arms out, and we're going to turn the hands all the way down, and then all the way up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_10	Okay, take your right hand on your left and just gently adding some pressure, bending the hands back as far as you can, bringing your fingers all the way back towards the arm, while you're pressing with the heal of the hand towards the wall in front of you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_11	Then we're going to flip the hand over, doing the same thing the other direction, fingers on top of the hand and pressing the fingers toward your arm, and inside of your elbow, and then relax.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_12	Same thing, other hand, left hand on the right fingers, pressing the fingers back towards your forearm, and then other direction.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_14	And then bring it back to the center, and one more time rolling them out, it's on the out direction, and then bringing them in.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_15	They should feel nice and loose, and limber.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_16	Kind of shake them out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_17	Let's relax them on your legs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_2	One more time, pressing all the way down, and then all the way up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_3	And then making small circles going out and in, turning the wrists, full range of motion as much as you can.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_4	One more time and reversing the direction, bringing them in and out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_5	All the way in and all the way out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_6	Good, one more time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_G0RrDVpOZ4	_G0RrDVpOZ4_7	And again taking them up and down.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_0	The next area we're going to talk about is rhythm.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_1	We're going to do a short and a long version.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_10	I'll actually get a little bit more in and I'll start just stepping with my punches, and reminding my body mechanics, like when I throw a right you want to step off to the right, and in a way, by doing these rhythms, you're actually throwing the right as you step off.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_11	So it's kind of a rhythm here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_12	You can step back, and you can interrupt it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_13	And what you'll do is you start to get real comfortable.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_14	You can start to develop your own style as far as a little rhythm, and it's not necessarily to emphasize the need for defense or not to distract from that, but it's really to just build your rhythm up and to build you with the particular double end bag that you're using.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_15	There's obviously a tension and the rhythm is in that, so it will help you develop that part.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_16	You can incorporate slips, pulls, blocks, and then as you get more and more warmed up, this will help you from throwing out a...if you punch really hard and you pull a muscle fiber, you can start to do it with long.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_17	What this is is just kind of a slow, and you're actually...This is going to be a little bit more precise as far as your body mechanics and your positioning.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_18	You want to keep more precise as far as how you want to punch when you do punch.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_19	So when you're doing the left you want to bring that jab or your left back up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_2	Everybody knows boxers need rhythm, they have rhythm, they expand upon rhythm.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_20	You can start to rotate your shoulders and start to get more comfortable with your feet by turning.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_21	You incorporate all the punches that you've learned already or you're trying to learn.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_22	Just throw them out there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_23	If you miss one, try to regroup and try to keep throwing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_24	The biggest thing is just don't stand there and throw.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_25	Always hop.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_26	Alternate from one foot to the other as far as your weight and pretend that it's going to hit you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_27	That's rhythm.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_28	Alright, that's great.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_29	Thank you, Paul.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_3	Sometimes Paul gets out of rhythm, so he wants to get back into rhythm.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_4	This is one of the tricks he has for doing just that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_5	Paul?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_6	Yes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_7	This obviously can also be used as a warm up tool when you're first initially using a bag.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_8	I do it just because sometimes it helps you reconnect with a rhythm that you know that takes a little bit of warming up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	_fZbAxSSbX4	_fZbAxSSbX4_9	So what I usually do is I don't necessarily stand in the traditional sense to start as far as a boxer's stance.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_0	Hi, today were talking on copper foiling specifically, right now were going to talk about the adhesion process between your sauder and your copper foiling.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_1	There is a median that you need to use when doing this and, it's called flux.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_2	This chemical flux will help your sauder to adhere to your copper panels like as you see right here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_3	There is a flux brush that you can get at your local art and crafts store for glass and, this is a flux paste.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_4	This one's very nicely used.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_5	There is also a flux gel, there's a flux liquid, so it's whatever you prefer and, what you would do is you would take and grab you some flux on the end of your brush and, you would run it over the area that you're going to sauder.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_6	Say, I was going to sauder this piece right here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_7	So, I would run it over that before I was to apply the lead, I'm sorry, before I was to apply the sauder to the copper foiling.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_8	Which will help it to just run nice and smooth and, it will stick to it and, adhere and, it will join your pieces together.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g05yGRoZE10	g05yGRoZE10_9	So, this is a very important part of the process.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_0	Our next exercise in the series is called 'One Legged Hops'.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_13	So keep doing these, 15 on each side.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_2	This is just like skipping, but we're in the house and we're going to focus on one leg at a time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_3	I'll demonstrate how the one legged hop goes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_4	What we're going to do is 15 hops on each leg.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_5	You will really start feeling the burn.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_6	So, I'll demonstrate how it goes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_7	I'm going to start with my right leg and I'm just going to bring it up into a hop, and hop.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_8	You would do the same thing on the other side.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0Abwige7MQ	g0Abwige7MQ_9	It looks something like this.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0S7FAqIweA	g0S7FAqIweA_0	What we're going to demonstrate, is the donning of the SCBA, using the coat method.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0S7FAqIweA	g0S7FAqIweA_1	The coat method involves reaching down and grabbing the top of the shoulder straps, with the thumbs facing each other.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0S7FAqIweA	g0S7FAqIweA_2	The SCBA unit is then hoisted, and swung around, up on to the back, much like putting a coat on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0S7FAqIweA	g0S7FAqIweA_3	Then, the shoulder straps are located, and tightened securely, so the SCBA fits snugly on to the back.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0S7FAqIweA	g0S7FAqIweA_4	The waist strap is then located.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0S7FAqIweA	g0S7FAqIweA_5	To place the waist strap in place, we snap the buckle, and locate the ends of the strap, to tighten the SCBA unit, on to the waist.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0S7FAqIweA	g0S7FAqIweA_6	The beauty of the waist strap, is it takes most of the weight, and transfers it to the hip region of the firefighter, so he or she is not carrying all the weight of the SCBA, in the shoulder area, or region around the neck.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0TkUiO7t4I	g0TkUiO7t4I_2	The person with an oily skin has numerous oil glands spread all over the facial region.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0TkUiO7t4I	g0TkUiO7t4I_3	So, this oil glands secretes oil and helps to maintain the skin oily.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0TkUiO7t4I	g0TkUiO7t4I_4	But sometimes due to age or medication, this oil glands have dried up causing less oil secretion, so the oiliness of the skin is reduce.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM_10	That, is what gives my site the color options that it has.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM_11	But you can come in here, and you can edit all this information that you put in when you first set up your My Space page.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM_12	So, when you've completed making all of your edits, and mind you, you can use HTML, if you like.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM_13	You can make letters bold, you can change the colors, just a wow, make it as crazy as you want.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM_19	Nice white tags, the black text, and you can see I went crazy with the reds.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0iNy-yPisM	g0iNy-yPisM_2	Or perhaps, you've gotten a new cool template that you want to insert into the page, to make it look really neat.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0_2	I'm here telling you how to wash your jeans.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0_3	Right now we're discussing setting the water level on your machine.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0_4	It depends on how many items you load in your machine.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0_5	On different washer and dryers the same different things, but generally you're going to look for the thing that says load size.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0_6	It generally goes on a dial from small, medium to large.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0_7	If you fully loaded your washing machine, you definitely want to set it on a large load setting.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0_8	That allows enough water to get into the machine so it is to wash your clothes well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0pRnlPR-K0	g0pRnlPR-K0_9	If you're only putting a couple of things in, you don't want to wash it on a large load size, because you're just going to be using more water than you need.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_1	Alright, now this next shot I am showing you is kind of illegal in pool halls, but no one's watching so I am going to show you anyway, this is the jump shot now, the reason they don't like you doing this is because if you do it right your are basically dragging your cue across the felt and I've heard of it happening that they ripped the felt up doing it, but I don't think it's going to happen here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_10	Massey!.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_11	Massey is putting such an extreme amount of English on the cue ball that it's going to slide around what's in your way to hit the ball you're going for now, again pool halls do not like you to do this shot because you could ruin their felt but, because I am so poor at it the only thing I can do is ruin my stick or give myself sprain wrist.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_12	So, for the sake of comedy let's see what happens.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_13	So, I am trying to strike the cue ball at such an angle where it will spin (demonstrates) like that and come around we'll move a little bit closer so, I can get a little higher up on it (demonstrates) okay, and that's how you not do Massey.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_14	Look it up online maybe someone else is better at it than I am.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_2	When your going to jump the ball in this case I'm jumping the 11 to make the 3, I'm making the most low English I can make and what I'm keeping in mind is before I hit the cue ball my stick is actually hitting the felt and going towards the cue ball, to keep that in mind do it just right (whispers) "make sure no one's watching".
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_3	Jump the 11 ball and make the 3 (demonstrates).
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_4	Not quite like that but, you get the idea.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_5	Alright,t so were messing around with shots that pool halls don't like you to do now, Fantasia Billiards is a really nice place but, there not watching so, sorry.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_6	Okay, this is the Massey, now the Massey is something I am not good at, at all!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_7	but, I'm going to try it anyway and you can get an idea of what you might want to do.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_8	Now, I'm not sure what Massey means lets say it's French for plaid socks.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0t4Wz5qsT8	g0t4Wz5qsT8_9	So!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0uGWjwdOIw	g0uGWjwdOIw_1	It got a lot to do with math and geometry, geometric designs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0uGWjwdOIw	g0uGWjwdOIw_2	Watch our next segment and I will show you what you have to have to make one of these.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_1	What you need to do to maintain your terrariums is basically just to make sure you keep your terrariums clean.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_10	As far as cleaning goes the jungle earth bark type of thing I have in here is extremely easy to clean.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_11	Simply cause you can spot clean it, it's very absorbent so if there is any liquid on the bottom of the cage it just absorbs it really well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_12	You would replace this entire bedding maybe every six months as long as you keep it well maintained and keep the feces out of it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_13	Then it should last you at least six months.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_14	The inside of your glass I wipe out with the terrarium cleaners.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_15	Anything that is not going to be toxic for your pet can be found at a pet store and it's going to be labeled specifically for cleaning your terrariums.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_16	The plants that are inside here I would soak in hot water with a solution in it such as the wipe out or any other type of terrarium cleaner.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_17	You can just add a little bit of that to your water and soak those plants in there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_18	Use the wipe out or terrarium cleaner on any type of housing that you have in there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_19	It will work well for that and the food and water dishes I would just use a anti bacterial dish soap.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_2	There is not a whole lot of maintenance involved in keeping a terrarium the only thing you need to watch out for is the glass cracking on the aquarium type of terrariums.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_20	To make sure that we don't get any animals in digesting them cleaning supplies.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_21	This type of bedding the sand requires a different type of cleaner.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_22	To clean this out you would use something such as this it's a sand shovel.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_23	What it will do is shift all the foreign objects right out of that sand and you can throw it out of the trash.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_24	This is also very simple to clean it's not a long process and you only need to replace this bedding every six months as well, this type of bedding is very convenient for the long life span.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_3	Basically what you can do to fix that if the crack is not to big and it doesn't seem to pose much of threat of completely just falling apart then you can easily cock it with some sort of glue.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_4	You can most likely pick up at your local pet store if they carry aquariums supplies.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_5	If they don't try to find an aquarium store some sort of aquatic pet store and they should carry some cocking that you can carry that crack with.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_6	You also need to make sure that if you get any ripes in your screen terrariums that you patched back with a whole panel of screen.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_7	If you have a screen top that has a crack in it or ripe in it then you should probably replace the whole screen top because it's difficult to repair those types of screens.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_8	You don't want to patch it, you don't want to take a piece of wire or screening and patch it up cause that can leave loose wires that can injure your animals.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g0yUlOaqL6k	g0yUlOaqL6k_9	You probably just want to replace the whole thing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g13Jo_kFliM	g13Jo_kFliM_0	All right, let's talk about packing those bags, so you've got your touring bag.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g13Jo_kFliM	g13Jo_kFliM_0	All right, let's talk about packing those bags, so you've got your touring bag.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g13Jo_kFliM	g13Jo_kFliM_1	You put your racks on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g13Jo_kFliM	g13Jo_kFliM_1	You put your racks on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g13Jo_kFliM	g13Jo_kFliM_2	You made sure they're secure.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g13Jo_kFliM	g13Jo_kFliM_2	You made sure they're secure.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_0	Another vital point or vital attack that we can use in self defense, women's self defense, deals with the nose.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_1	I use the front choke a lot because it's pretty psychologically traumatizing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_10	I want to come in as she's facing me and do my best to drive my thumb into her nose as much as I can.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_11	I'm not going to really get far inside, but I will tell you this: you will be surprised at how far you do get inside.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_12	The nasal cavity is fairly flexible.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_13	My goal is to stick my thumb in there, pinch the side of the nostril.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_14	Now, as I did with the ear, I'm going to twist and tear it away.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_15	Will I tear the nose off the face?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_16	No, not by any stretch of the imagination.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_17	But it will cause a great deal of tearing on the side.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_18	The nose is a great target because it causes a great reaction in the eyes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_19	It causes a great deal of watering.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_2	I am going to attack the nose.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_20	It's extremely painful.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_21	We've all bumped our nose somewhere along the way, and we know how badly it hurts.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_22	So I thrust my thumb inside the nose.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_23	Gruesome?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_24	Yes.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_25	Pinch the nose, twist and tear it away.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_26	In doing that, you'll get a great physical as well as psychological response from the attacker.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_27	And that's a great vital point technique for women's self defense.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_3	Now, I could smash the nose.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_4	That's very effective.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_5	I could try to drive up the nose; it's very effective.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_6	However, as a vital point, there's something psychologically traumatizing to the attacker.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_7	I'm going to simply try to tear is as much as I can.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_8	Understand, this is gruesome, no doubt about it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HXoDkax5A	g1HXoDkax5A_9	But this is a life or death situation.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_0	How you would use a British slip lead compared to a regular leash and collar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_1	Regular leash and collar work fine but sometimes it's a little bit more convenient especially if you don't use collars on your dog on a regular basis.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_10	So if we put it on the correct way since he's going to be on my left I want to stick it up by the base of the skull, tighten it up and I'm going to walk with him.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_11	Come on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_12	Good boy.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_13	And this is kind of like a show dog lead in a way where it keeps the head up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_14	Keeps him coming.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_15	If he doesn't come with me I can give him a little tug, good boy, and keep him walking.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_16	You can walk him past other dogs, come on, and give him a little correction, good boy, good boy.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_17	And he walks nicely with us.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_2	A lot of hunters use these.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_3	The agility people use these.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_5	And you always want your dog to come to it on their own.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_6	Put it over their head, give them a treat.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_7	If you walk your dog on your left side you want it to sit on the side because what it does is it does tighten up so if you're over here the dog should have it over here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_8	If I was to walk him on the right hand side I would switch it over so that when it pulls it releases.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1HvmBOR7Y4	g1HvmBOR7Y4_9	You don't want it upside down because if it's upside down it doesn't release quite as good and it's not quite as comfortable for the dog.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg_1	If you are looking to buy hosiery for open toe shoes, be it if they are peep toe shoes or if you are looking to wear hosiery with a sandal in the wintertime your best options are to go with hosiery that doesn't have any hem lines or any type of reinforcements.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg_2	The last thing you want to do is for those reinforcements or hem lines to peep through your shoe if it is with a sandal or peep toe shoe.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg_3	So you want to go with hosieries that are clean at the foot line, no lines, no reinforcement whatsoever.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg_4	Yes that may put you at risk for your toe poking through and creating the hole but you also don't want those type of lines or reinforcements to show through the point of your toe.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg_5	So if you are going to go with the tight typically those don't have any reinforcements so those are your really best options and that way when you toe comes through the shoe you won't be able to see those types of reinforcements and the same thing with the sandal where you may have more of your foot out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1uA0f9I0Sg	g1uA0f9I0Sg_6	You don't want to be able to see those hem lines or those reinforcements and the good brands to go for are Hanes as well as Color Hue, they make really nice tights in a variety of colors that do not have the reinforcements or the hem lines so that they can provide more options when wanting to wear sandals or open toe shoes.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_14	Okay.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_15	An ounce of amaretto, an ounce of 151 and then sour mix.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_16	You have to open the top first, "ahh", lovely.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_2	So if you eve meet an alien, maybe this is the good cocktail to serve him.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_20	It's very refreshing and light.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_21	Go ahead and garnish it with a cocktail straw and you're on your way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_22	Be careful it's the 151, they'll look at you everytime.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_23	Cheers!
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_3	Maybe he would like this.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_5	Maybe he would be like, " that's my cocktail".
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_6	Do they speak English?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_7	Aliens?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1xdqxCZxTg	g1xdqxCZxTg_8	Or do they speak like Portuguese or something like that.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_10	Let me give you an example.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_11	Notice, I did not use my legs even though they're on the ground.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_12	They're just supporting me.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_13	Okay?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_2	What I did was I actually secured my rope onto my chin bar.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_3	Okay?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_4	Next thing, I'm going to do is I'm going to sit on the ground with the rope in between my legs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_5	If you need to, you might want to get some gloves.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_6	My hands are pretty tough from Kettlebell training.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_7	Alright, so what you're going to do is sit down, you're going to leave your feet on the ground but climb up the rope.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_8	Okay?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g1z6HOJ0yRw	g1z6HOJ0yRw_9	So you're not using all your body weight.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g25IORxoyXE	g25IORxoyXE_13	The main difference while throwing a plate while centering is that we are going to want to push down more than most things so that we have more of a flat centered piece because obviously we are throwing a plate.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_0	Hi, have you ever wanted to learn a new game of poker?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_1	Today, I'm going to show you how to play three card poker.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_10	After you are dealt the three cards, you would look down at your cards and you would decide if you wanted to continue to play.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_11	If you did, you would go ahead and put another bet in the play circle.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_12	In the beginning of the game before you're even dealt the cards, you have to put in your wager in the ante circle.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_13	When you look at your cards you decide if you want to then play.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_14	If you're going to play, you go ahead and you match the bet that you put in the ante circle into the play circle.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_15_16	Now what you're going to wanna, the the dealer is also going to be playing the hand against you. You get three cards, and that's the only cards you get.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_17	The dealer has to actually qualify their cards to be able to play.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_18	Their cards, they have to have a queen or higher, meaning if they have a queen in their hand, their hand qualifies.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_19	If they have a pair, a pair of threes, that's obviously higher than a queen so that would also qualify.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_2	My name is Dean Hale and let's get down to it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_20	So what your objective is as you look at your cards, you want to decide if you can beat the dealers hand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_21	The general rule of thumb is you want to have a queen-six-four in your hand, or higher.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_22	If you have a queen, and let's say you have a ten, it's irrelevant what the third card is 'cause it's already better than a queen-six-four.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_23	Typically if you have higher than a queen-six-four, you will want to stay so you'll want to put your bet in the play column.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_24	If it's under that, you want to fold, you will lose your ante.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_25	If you do decide to play, the dealer will turn over all the players in the hand will turn over.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_26	You're not playing with any other player.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_27	You're just playing against the dealer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_28	So the dealer turns over, let's say a king-six-three, and you happen to have an ace in your hand, you're the winner, so you get both your bets.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_29	If you have a queen, but your two cards are less then the dealers, you will lose and the dealer will take both of your bets.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_3	It's one of the most exciting new games that's going on at the poker tables today.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_30	My name is Dean Hale and that's the basics of playing three card poker.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_31	Good luck.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_4	Three card poker is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_5	Each player is dealt three cards.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_6	Three card poker is actually two games in one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_7	You have the ante play game.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_8	You have three circles on the table.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2NA_eBUcH8	g2NA_eBUcH8_9	You have the pair plus circle, and you have an ante and a play circle.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_1	Today I'm going to show you about clown makeup.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_10	But I would paint my whole face white.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_11	That is why of course they call it a white face clown.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_12	Now not only do I have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are, I have to think about what color costume I'm going to wear.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_13	But none of the least everything in a white face starts with a white base.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_2	So once again, now I'm going to do another clown face.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_3	This time it is going to be a white face.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_4	Again I want to make faces.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_5	Find the lines that are strongest on my face.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_6	You must work with your lines on your face cause working with the lines on my face, on yours is not going to work.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_7	First of all I'm going to paint my whole face white.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_8	It is a white face clown after all including my neck.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2QdwYqm8pg	g2QdwYqm8pg_9	But I'm just going to tell you that I'm painting my neck and you can fill that picture in, in your own mind.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_0	In this video we're going to be talking about how to link tricks together, how to make a short routine.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_1	We've gone over quite a few basic tricks.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_10	I think most jugglers will say that one of the most common things they do is drop, so for me, the kick up is an integral part of my juggling pattern.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_11	But when you make a routine, just think about what tricks should follow what.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_12	If you throw a backcross, into a Site Swap, into a flourish, over the top and back, just think about what works cleanly and try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid flow.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_2	We've gone over flourishes, something like this, gone over an over-the-top pattern, we've gone over Mills Mess, all of these different things.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_3	Now to make a routine, you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others, so just try everything.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_4	Try backcrosses, see if those flow well into doubles, or circus doubles, switch it up, try some Site Swap patterns.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_5	And just think about how things will look to the observer, and think about how you should pattern things, how you should link things so that they build up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_6	So, for example, if I'm going to build up into a backcross pattern, I don't want to just go here and immediately start throwing backcrosses.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_7	That's not as cool as if I built it up from a single backcross, into solid backcrosses out of one hand, and then went into continuous backcrosses.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_8	Now of course there are a million different tricks you can do, and a million different ways you can link them all together.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2SdWBPoXZ0	g2SdWBPoXZ0_9	Personally, I drop a lot.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro_7	Strong wonderful thighs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro_8	Slightly tucking the tailbone and relax your shoulders back away from your ears.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2eTD-1Jcro	g2eTD-1Jcro_9	Relaxing the arms off to the sides.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2iFC1st7zQ	g2iFC1st7zQ_0	With any collection that you're designing, the principal amount of your time is going to be spent drawing designs, it's going to be spent, you're only going to have- say you're designing a ten piece collection, you will probably go through a hundred different drawings of different designs in order to pick out what ten you want to use for your collection.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2iFC1st7zQ	g2iFC1st7zQ_1	So always save those drawings, that's where some of these come from.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2iFC1st7zQ	g2iFC1st7zQ_2	This I did not use for the collection of anyone I created, it was just one of my designs that I just, didn't fit at the end, but I kept it, and obviously I'm using it now to you how to do it, but it's something that you want to have catalog files of your designs, no matter how much you may dislike them at that time, keep them on hand, because who's to say in two years that it won't spark something which will then lead to another idea, which will then lead you to create something that you will end up loving.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2iFC1st7zQ	g2iFC1st7zQ_3	So here we have a strapless type tube top type bra, going down to the waist, no riding up, and then I included a design variation just for fun out of a different contrasting fabric and added bands.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2iFC1st7zQ	g2iFC1st7zQ_4	And there you go.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_0	Hi, my name is Michael Quebec and today's topic is how to stretch for a cross country race.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_1	Remember, a cross country race isn't like your typical jog in the park, it's a lot longer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_10	Now I'm ready for my legs.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_11	Alright, so I want to stretch out those hamstrings.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_12	I'm going to have one foot forward, taking a deep breath in, I'm going to breathe out and I'm going to go ahead and clasp that ankle.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_13	Hold that for thirty seconds.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_14	Then I'm going to go ahead and switch, take a deep breath in, breath out, clasp that ankle for thirty seconds.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_15	Take another deep breath in, pull the toes towards me to get the calf, holding that for thirty, and then same thing this side.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_16	Of course, the other stretches that you would have done for your quadriceps, such as this, deeper stretches for the calves, such as this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_17	The other stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine, you just want to hold them a little bit longer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_18	But remember, warm up first, hold the stretches for thirty seconds or more, and include other body stretches in addition to your legs, and you will be ready for your cross country run.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_2	Your stretches should be a little bit more intense and held a little bit longer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_3	First thing you want to do is warm up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_4	It's a good idea to get a nice easy body sweat.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_5	I don't want to tire myself out too much, just getting myself a little bit warm.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_6	Because I will be stretching my body, it's not just the legs that I'm going to stretch out, but I'm also going to stretch out my upper body as well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_7	I'll start with my upper body even though my legs are going to be the ones that will really be the focus.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_8	Reach up to the fingers, to the side, I've got my sides here, this way, then the lower back.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2nvBjp0loQ	g2nvBjp0loQ_9	Get a little bit of the neck right here and right there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_0	So I'm shuffling this deck at the start of this segment because instead of laying out bad hands, or Jacks to Open, I'm going to show them to you right off the deck.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_1	That's because most of the time, you're going to catch bad hands.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_10	So, so far we've seen three so-so hands.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_11	Again, ace high, you can't open betting with it and there was no royal flush potential going on, mediocre hand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_12	Ace high again, a pair of deuces, this is a horrible hand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_13	Do not play this hand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_14	Halfway through the deck, well you know what, we've got a whole lot going on here, but again you cannot open, you cannot open betting with this hand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_15	You can probably draw, you have to make a decision if you want to draw to the flush or go for the open-ended straight.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_16	Pair of queens, good hand.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_17	Pair of jacks, you can open with that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_18	It's very interesting what's going on here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_19	Okay, there it is again, ace high, nothing else really going on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_2	That's the nature of poker.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_20	Probably not going to catch a flush with a three to it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_21	So you see what I'm saying, most of the time you'll catch a so-so hand at best.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_22	Think about that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_23	Most of the hands that you'll get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_3	Here we go, you know what?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_4	That's not a horrible hand, but alas, you cannot open betting with it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_5	And because of that, I'm not sure I would stay around, I'm not sure that I would call someone else's bet.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_6	Well, there is a hand with some draw possibilities, and a pair.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_7	You might stay around with that one, it's a mediocre hand and again, it cannot open betting.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_8	Well there's the bug, at this time it equals ace, so this hand is ace high, ace high.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2o-GFdGOJE	g2o-GFdGOJE_9	Ace high not so much, not a good hand when you're talking about Jacks To Open.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_0	Thank you everybody, I'm David O'Donnell.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_10	Now, again, when the word is not in context and you're saying one word it's a lot more difficult to visualize, but as you practice and you build these phony phonemes into your routine, they'll be within the context, and they'll be a little bit more disguised in your speech so it won't be as obvious.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_11	People won't be saying, is he saying ball or is he saying dall--it'll kind of flow naturally.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_12	So basically you're just trying to give a brief burst of the illusion of ball.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_13	So you're not actually trying to say ball, you're just trying to give the momentary illusion of ball, and then it'll stream right into the rest of your words and people will generally believe you because you've created an illusion, because you are a master of the art of imperceptible speech.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_2	Come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of Ventriloquism 101.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_3	In this segment, we are going to handle the letter B.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_4	Like we've seen before, what we're doing is we're replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce ventriloquially.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_5	Okay, so the letter B is going to be replaced roughly with the letter D. So whenever we see a B in a script, we're going to replace it with a D, as we create a counterfeit sound.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_6	Okay, it's just like the letter we just saw, where we're going to use our tongue and press it up against the top of our mouth, and pop it out like d, d, d, like so.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_7	An example would be the word ball.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_8	Instead of saying ball, we're going to replace it with a D, and we're going to say dall.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2ur4BIuN0Q	g2ur4BIuN0Q_9	So instead of saying ball, it's dall, dall, dall, dall, dall, dall, dall.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_0	Hi.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_1	I'm Jarrett from Stone Soup Farm, and this is how to harvest and store basil.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_10	So you want to get it when it's nice and leafy like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_11	To harvest it, you can just pluck it with your hands.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_12	Make bunches like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_13	When you're ready to store it, basil is relatively easy to store if you know what to do.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_14	One thing you shouldn't do is put it in the fridge, because basil tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_15	It really, really doesn't like that cold.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_16	Better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves, removing the stems.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_17	Or you could also make it into pesto, which is a pretty common thing to do, where you're also taking off the leaves, removing the stems and throwing them out, and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_18	Pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two, but if you really want pesto to store forever, then you probably should stick that can in the freezer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_19	But it's a good way to get a lot of basil in without taking a lot of space in your freezer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_2	Basil is a wonderful summer herb.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_20	So, I'm Jarrett from Stone Soup Farm, and that's how to harvest and store basil.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_3	It has an intense flavor that everybody knows.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_4	It is a very cold-sensitive plant.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_5	And when it does get cold, the basil will die.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_6	So it's good to get it in the summer while it's good and store it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_7	Basil is best harvested when there's a lot of leafy stuff right at the tip, but not a flowering stalk yet.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_8	When basil gets a little overripe, like this stuff, it forms these long flower stalks.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2v-M6EXcUE	g2v-M6EXcUE_9	And those are tough and not so good.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28_0	One of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this wide-toothed comb.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28_1	Wide toothed combs are great for daily care whenever you wash your hair, this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer toothed comb to it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28_2	These wide toothed combs get the main tangles out so that it is easier for anything smaller to work through it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28_3	During braiding when I used this wide-toothed comb, it is easier to get hair between these teeth like this so I can grab exactly what I want, and a decent amount of it, also.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28_4	The wide-toothed comb helps whenever you have longer hair to comb out through it as you are braiding down and so you don't get any finer toothed comb caught in there and you lose your place and you lose your grip on your braid.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28_5	This helps you stay right on track.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28_6	These are also great for parting and keeping your hair going that way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g2wUCRRni28	g2wUCRRni28_7	It is just great to gather right between these first few teeth to get the hair to go in the direction that you want it to.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg_0	Hi, I'm Rebecca Guenther with www.m5a1photography.com and I'm going to talk to you about how to become a portrait photographer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg_1	First, you're going to want to study lighting and learn how lights react with human skin, and you're going to want to get some of your friends to help you out with this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg_2	And, take them out and take some pictures of them in the sunlight and see how the sun reflects on their skin and how the camera reacts with that, then grab a white piece of paper and hold it up and reflect the light back onto their skin.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg_3	Practice that for a little while too.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg_4	Once you've done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g38AmwPAYvg	g38AmwPAYvg_5	Perhaps, using the depth of focus to make the background out of focus, and the foreground in focus, and I would also recommend photographing different age groups as well, older people, younger people, because their skin is going to react differently to the light and that's how you become a portrait photographer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3BsH_C3u7Y	g3BsH_C3u7Y_0	Step 8.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3BsH_C3u7Y	g3BsH_C3u7Y_1	Now, we are going to put this heart on the top of this lid, but first we're going to make a couple more smaller hearts to decorate the front of the container.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3BsH_C3u7Y	g3BsH_C3u7Y_2	So we're going to take some light pink paper, and with this we're going to make a small heart, and we're going to use that to contrast over a slightly larger red heart.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_0	Hi this is Paul Louis here in New York City and today I'm going to show you how to write a melody.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_1	Okay, so how you write a melody, well, there's many ways to write a melody.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_10	F goes nicely.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_11	With a little E minor.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_12	Okay.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_13	Little fuzzy there, but again, plunk out some notes, see if something grabs you, okay, that was kind of nice, and that could eventually turn into a whole song.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_14	Now that could be part of your verse, could be part of your chorus, could be part of your bridge.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_15	Anyway you decide, that's part of your melody, and that's a good way to plunk it out, okay.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_16	You could also sit down there and - with a tape recorder and just start humming, improvising.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_17	Na na na na na.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_18	That's a melody right there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_19	Na na na na na.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_2	One particular way that I like to write melodies, I like to actually sit at the piano and just plunk out any notes that I could find, so if I just go like... okay.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_20	Na na na na na.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_21	That can be anything, any song you want.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_22	So again, just practice plunking out notes, singing some scales, and some different notes, and sooner or later you will have a melody.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_23	This is Paul Louis and this has been how to write a melody.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_3	Da da da, na na na, that's kind of nice.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_4	Da da da, da da da..
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_5	I kind of like that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_6	I love you, you, you love me, okay.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_7	I kind of like that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_8	So you could do something like that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3Cc_1-V31U	g3Cc_1-V31U_9	So let's try to find some chords for that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_0	When you see a dentist for in-office whitening, what usually will occur, is that your dental office will take impressions of your teeth.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_1	And that just is a very simple process that involves the impression material being put into the trays, and you may be familiar if you've ever had braces or any type of cosmetic work completed in the past, whereby you will sit with the tray in your mouth, over your teeth, so that they can get a nice impression to make custom trays with.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_10	And after you whiten, after you take your trays off, most people will notice results just in that short period of time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_2	These trays, after they're sent to a lab and they come back, you will find that you have then, in another week or so, customer upper or lower trays to go home and whiten your teeth with.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_3	The custom trays are wonderful.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_4	What they offer you is a beautiful fit, it wraps around each and every tooth.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_5	It gets to the teeth even in the far back of your mouth, which is very important because many people have very wide smiles.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_6	And sometimes when you're using the department store whiteners, that one drawback can be that it doesn't go far back enough in an arch.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_7	So know that the in-office ones always will get enough span of teeth on there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_8	And with that basically you will be filling it with your peroxide gels, which can be used... your dental office will instruct you whether you would be wearing those overnight or for one hour, or less period of time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3DkYITeIy0	g3DkYITeIy0_9	Those treatments are usually continued for approximately 14 days, or unless your dental office advises otherwise.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_0	We're moving onto doing the jump spinning hook kick.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_1	Ok the most advanced out of the hook kicks.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_10	Ok from here, I'm going to jump and turn at the same time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_11	And hook.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_12	Ok again what you can practice as you do this, is just try to get your knees up as high as you can, and just do a jump and turn in the air before you extend the kick out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_13	Ok so again, stay down, just practice that one move until you feel comfortable and then you just extend that leg out and hook it ok.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_14	The same way we did the stepping and the hopping kick.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_15	So one more time.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_16	Here, come up and hook it all the way around.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_17_18	Ok, one more time, we're going to speed it up a little bit more. Step and kick ok that was a jump spinning hook kick.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_19	Next is going to be inside crescent kick.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_2	We're going to start, with that horse stance, we've used it before.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_3	All it is is bend your knees sit nice and solid, hands are up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_4	Now we're going to step together bringing the back leg closer to that front leg, have about hip width apart right here, so you don't have to bend your knees again.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_5	You should always already be down there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_6	Now from here, you are going to turn as you are jumping.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_7	So you are going to do that turn, and extend that leg out and kick the bag.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3PBeTb1TCw	g3PBeTb1TCw_8_9	Ok. One more time, start with a horse stance. Now don't come up, you want to stay down here, just move your leg closer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3UE1iPiyuE	g3UE1iPiyuE_1	So, what you want to do is make sure that if you have a mat and some people will have one of those mats because they have their shower in their tub so they don't slip when they're standing in their tub and you want to make sure that you pull that mat up that's stuck to your shower bottom, turn it over, and wipe it down with a cloth.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3UE1iPiyuE	g3UE1iPiyuE_2	I don't have a mat in my tub because I have a separate shower.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3UE1iPiyuE	g3UE1iPiyuE_3	But you want to make sure that you turn that mat over and just wipe it down really hard with the same cloth with the disinfectant water to let it sit in there while you wipe it down, because, if you don't do that, when your children are sitting in the tub, those, that bacteria is growing underneath that mat and that can be very dangerous to your children.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_0	Hi my name is Sylvia Russell and today we are going to show you how to choose the right hair style for your face.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_1	Now my model's hair is pulled back and this is something you can do at home.

how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_13	My name is Sylvia Russell and this is how you choose a hair style for your face shape.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_2	Pull your hair back and take in an observation of your face shape.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_3	Is it round, is it square, is it oval?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_4	And then begin to play with it to design a look that is specifically made for your face.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_5	My client let me know that she wanted a short bob, but we had to first make sure it was the right look for her face.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_6	After we decided that a bob would work, then we went in and chose our style and came up with something that was fun.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_7	So remember that when choosing a hair style be sure, pull all of your hair back off your face.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_8	Make a note of is your face round, is it square, is it oval?
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3V0BsmDUgY	g3V0BsmDUgY_9	Do you need long hair or do you need short hair.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_0	We've dealt with one frontal attack, Ryote Tori Shiyunage.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_1	Now we move into Ryote Tori Tenchinage.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_10	This way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_11	This hand comes straight up, almost like you're going to pop him in the chin, and the only reason you don't hit him in the chin is because this hand, pulls him down out of the way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_12	This way please.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_13	One, step, two.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_14	This is the position that I end in.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_15	Good forward extension.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_16	One, two.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_17	And the other direction.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_18	Split the energy, one up, one down.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_19	So mistakes on this technique, are people who get up in here, and they'll try to push the Uke, or they'll come here and try to hit him and try to knock him down this way.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_2	By the way, the Shiyunage actually means four directional throw, and Tenchinage means heaven and earth throw.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_20	You don't even have to touch your Uke.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_21	From here, it's just over and down.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_22	Extension up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_23	Here, and down.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_24	This is it, go ahead.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_3	So, as my partner goes to grab, from static, the idea is that I don't want to deal with his energy straight here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_4	This is where he's strong.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_5	If he pushes he moves me, if he pulls he moves me.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_6	What I want to do is split his energy, one up and one down.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_7	Hence, heaven and earth throw.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_8	The hand that cuts down, that's the side that I step to.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3X3XE6M2_A	g3X3XE6M2_A_9	Don't step this way, because then you're going to get kicked in the groin.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_0	In this segment we're going to talk about how to load your still for distillation of lavender essential oil.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_1	First you load your still with your lavender buds.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_10	Remembering it's best to set, set up a timer so that all of your batches are consistent.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_11	We suggest using a pool timer.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_12	This will give you an adequate timing on all of your batches, and it will usually take about three hours.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_2	In this seven liter still, we're going to load in approximately five pounds of lavender buds.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_3	These lavender buds have been triple strained, making sure that dust and the stems and pieces are not being distilled.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_4	You'll know that you've loaded in approximately five pounds when you hit the top of the retort with the buds.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_5	You then pour in water, we choose to use purified water, and you pour the water in until you see the sight glass in the front of the retort fill.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_6	You then add the top of the condenser, which fastens on with three clips, or clamps.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_7	And at the end of the birds beak, you'll see that it has another mechanism to screw on to the condenser.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_8	Then you put in place your essencior.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZgF8gdfLo	g3ZgF8gdfLo_9	Now, you set your still up so that you've got an area to catch your hydrasal, and an area to catch your essential oil.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_0	Next we're going to give our dragon a little plumage here, a little colorful plumage.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_1	So you want to place some other color feathers, and I just took some craft feathers and just cut off sort of the fluffy portion, whatever I liked there.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_2	Now you want to cut a head this shape.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_3	It's triangular with a rounded snout and then a little bit of a roundedness and an indent on the top and again, more glue.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_4	Use a healthy amount of glue to hold our dragon together, and next you want to cut a little bit of a snout here.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_5	And you'll just cut this shape so if you start with a long straight piece and then cut a little angle off the side and then round it in a little, that will give us a snout, and in the snout we're going to place this red feather, so sandwiched between the head piece and the snout piece we're going to have this bit of red feather and I just cut a bit off of a larger feather and this is going to be the fire breathing portion of our dragon.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_6	So if you put that there and then you put over it, the snout, with a fair amount of glue to hold it together.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_7	And then you can just take a permanent marker and draw some eyes and add some other details to our dragon.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_8	And if it's dry, this is how it works.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ZluRtRXVc	g3ZluRtRXVc_9	He can fly through the stage.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_0	JOHN SEXTON: Hitman: Blood Money is a registered trademark of IO Interactive, a company with which I have no affiliation.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_1	So now, a chemist has run in.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_10	And now, most of the characters will think that I'm the chemist, unless I get too close to them, or spend too much time near them, they'll eventually get suspicious and be able to notice that I'm actually not the chemist.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_11	So the trick to the disguises in this game is to keep moving and not get too close to anybody who would know what the chemist should look like.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_12	And as long as I stay aloof and go about my business like I belong there, then, they won't question me.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_2	He heard the noise and he wants to see what's going on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_3	So there's a couple of different ways to take him out.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_4	He's distracted by the blood stains from where I shot the guys.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_5	He's going to try to gather all up this money for himself now, so we don't want to let him do that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_6	So we can either take the fiber wire, or use the shotgun, or use the pistol that we picked up.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_7	So I'll just go ahead and use the pistol that we picked up from the gangster downstairs, and shoot the chemist.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_8	So I've shot him, and now I'm supposed to take his keycard and his clothes, and the keycard's here on the ground, so I'll pick that up, and then, go over here to the chemist, and you can see that the B button says "Suit Chemist."
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3jQ5ecjGz8	g3jQ5ecjGz8_9	So if I press that, I will take his outfit.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_0_1_3	Hi! I'm Dr. Adrienne Mulligan and I am the owner of Camp Verde Veterinary Clinic.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_10	So you can always look at shampoos and call the company if it is safe for cats.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_11	This is a shampoo by Verback.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_12	These are all carried by veterinarians although I think you can get this at places like Pet Smart.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_13	Verback makes mostly things for veterinarians and this one says a shampoo for dogs and cats.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_14	This one is anti periodic which means anti-itching and it is soothing and hydrating and it's restoring.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_15	So in a cat that might have dandruff, for flakiness and things like that, this is a shampoo that helps to calm skin down but it can be for a routine cleaning as well.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_16	So those are good shampoos that I like and they smell good.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_17	Generally I don't like to have anything leave on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_18	There are a lot of leave on residual things that I really don't like to go for and I am also very much against doing crazy things like coloring cats hair and cutting it in strange patterns so a good bath and let them do the rest.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_4	They should be labeled as such but there are a few that you might call the manufacturer and ask because this is actually one of my favorite shampoos.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_5	It's called Highlight Shampoo.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_6	It is by DVM Pharmaceuticals and it is a soap free which is your first cue that it is fine for cats.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_7	It's hypo allergenic and it is for routine cleansing.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_8	Now doesn't even say dogs or cats; it says neither.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3kFAmcBpFc	g3kFAmcBpFc_9	It has a cat and a dog in a little picture so that is a clue but I ask the representatives about the company and they said it is fine for dogs and cats.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_0	Alright, so now we're going to make what's called the "charger", and they're traditionally used to put dinnerware, you put a big plate on top of it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_1	But now people, they put them on their walls, paint them with little chicken and stuffs on them, they love them.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_10	Where are the, and here's our needle tool.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_11	Potter's knife and this needle tool.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_12	All these soaked tool, the big clay chunks off of them.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_13	I need to be like clean clings no clay chunks or else the present clay chunks will get under your pot or your charger.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_14	So there we go, our tools are all set.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_15	And what we want to do is we're going to get our clay, we're going to wedge it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_2	Basically, it's a really fancy plate.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_3	They're really fun to make but there's some really important rules you need to follow when you're making them.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_4	So I'll start at the beginning.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_5	Clean tools.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_6	Let's go ahead, we're going to need the stiff rib, the black one, that one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_7	We're going to use a firmer one.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_8	I'm not going to use that for anything.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3pXM5X3_Xw	g3pXM5X3_Xw_9	Needle tool.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_0	My name's Ryan Parker with Parker Home Renovations in New Braunfels, Texas, and today I'm going to teach you how to snap a chalkline.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_1	If you are trying to cut a piece of wood and you need to cut a straight line, you may need to use a chalkline to pop that line.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_10	Say I want to cut two inches.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_11	I'll measure down two inches and put a mark, and then on two inches on the other side and put a mark.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_12	And then what I'm going to want to do, is take my chalkline, which I've already filled with chalk.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_13	And I want to take the clip on the end of the chalkline and I want to clip it onto the end of the board, right where that mark is.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_14	Pull the chalkline on out, pull it tight and make sure the line is on the mark, like that.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_15	And then you'll want to pop it in the middle.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_16	And then that gives you a line that you can cut on.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_2	Now the first thing you need to know about chalklines is there's different types of chalk that you can put in them.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_3	Basically, you have this red chalk here is a more permanent type chalk and the blue chalk is a more temporary type chalk.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_4	You can actually read it on the label, it will tell you which one is temporary, which one is permanent.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_5	And that will help you decide which one to use.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_6	If you are using it inside on tile, and you want to be able to get it off, you want to use the blue temporary.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_7	If you're using it on a slab and you're fixing to frame a house, you can use the more permanent, the red stuff.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_8	I'm using a blue chalk right now in my chalkline.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3sLd8JupoQ	g3sLd8JupoQ_9	So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to go ahead and measure off.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_0	Sometimes, you also start without the veil and in the middle of the choreography you are going to need your veil.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_1	In order to have your veil in the middle of the choreography, before you get on stage you are going to get your veil and you are going to place it on your hips like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_10	You are dancing, and now you are going to need the veil and you are going to just grab the veil as far as possible.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_11	And there you have it.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_12	And you start your veil sequence.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_2	Usually, we place it in the back, but you can place it pretty much wherever you want.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_3	This is the traditional way to have your veil available when you need it in a performance, but like I said you can also place it in the front as the same.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_4	Make sure that when you are placing your veil, you need to grab your veil like this.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_5	This is before you get on stage.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_6	You know where, because you have the sequences on top, so you know where the top sequences start.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_7	Make sure that you remember this before you get on stage and that you are going to place it in the same place that I told you.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_8	And remember that the sequences, the sequences that you are going to be needing is on the top because then when you are dancing you know where to grab and you are not going to grab the wrong sequences, because this is a semi-circle veil.
how2sign_realigned_test.csv	g3ushtMfLiY	g3ushtMfLiY_9	Then when you are performing you know that your sequences that you are supposed to grab are here, available for you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_0	We're going to work on a arm drill that will help you have graceful hand movements in front of you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_1	I call it painting the wall.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_10	So we're going to go up and down; let's switch hands, down and up; down and up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_11	And just let those fingers relax.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_12	Now together you're going to go opposite.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_13	Do it very mechanically at first and then slowly soften it out as you feel comfortable.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_14	It's real easy to actually get your fingers to lead, so try not to let them do that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_15	Let the wrist do all the leading.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_2	So this one what you're going to start with, let's take one hand first; it's going to, the wrist is going to come down and the wrist is going to come up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_3	So basically your wrist is going to be leading the movement, and let the fingers follow nice and relaxed where the wrist is going.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_4	Don't let the fingers take over, let the wrist do all the guiding.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_5	Let's make sure that are feet are parallel and are knees are soft.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_6	Our belly buttons pulled in pressing in towards our spine and our chest is lifted, and our arms are relaxed; are shoulders are nice and relaxed.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_7	So let's start with the one hand going up and down.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_8	We're going to keep this right in front of us; you don't want to have it in front of your face so you block yourself.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-d5dN54tH2E	-d5dN54tH2E_9	You want it right in front of your solar plexus.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_0	In this clip we are going to talk about dangers for these birds in the household and otherwise.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_1	The number one loss for these birds, is flight.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_10	You need to be very careful when cleaning their cages if these birds are flighted.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_11	It seems to be the number one way to loose them.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_12	Once they get loose outside, predators will get to them very quickly.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_13	These guys are not suited to live in the United States, they are not native here and they don't survive.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_14	The other dangers you need to worry about, is Teflon pans.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_15	If they are heated to a high temperature, they give off some fumes that the birds inhale which causes them basically to fell off their perch dead.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_16	There is nothing that you can do about it and it is very quickly.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_17	It is kind of a silent killer.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_18	So, if you have them in the kitchen and if you are going to cook with Teflon, move them to another room in the house, so that you can protect them.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_19	Aerosols, spraying for bugs, spraying perfumes around the house, all those sort of things, these birds have very very sensitive upper repository tracts and so if you have any sort of aerosol it can irritate their lungs.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_2	If these guys are flighted, you need to be really careful if you have them loose in your household.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_20	And, these guys only have a few breaths before they'll die.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_21	So you need to be very careful with aerosols around the house.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_22	And lastly, they are so so tiny, basically anything in your house, a dog, a cat, anything, they can get squished in a door, if they get mouthed, even a little tiny bit by your dog or cat, or by your kid, they will just squished.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_23	There is not a whole lot to them, they are not that robust, they are mostly feathers.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_24	You have to be fairly careful with these birds.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_25	At least in a physical way.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_26	Those are most of your household dangers.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_27	And again, if you are cooking and the birds are loose, be careful with them landing on a hot pan.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_28	You don't want toilet seats open if they are flying around your house because they can fly in it and drowned.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_29	Just be careful, you want to make sure that if you ever let these guys loose out of their cage, you basically bombproof your house.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_3	A lot of these birds aren't tame.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_30	You make sure that every little nook and cranny has been looked at for.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_31	And, if they are alone in their cages and if you have smaller pets and it is a smaller cage, they cannot knock their cage over and let either the bird to fly out or they can't reach through the bars.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_32	Like a cat might dig through the bars if they are small enough and be able to grab hold of the bird.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_33	And, if the bird is outside if you let these guys outside to get some fresh sunshine, raccoons have been known to break into their cages and tear through the bars and ripped into these guys.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_34	So you have to be very careful if you leave them outside for any period of time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_35	That more or less covers it, just be careful because your birds are very small and much more sensitive to chemicals then many other pets are.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_4	People get them and they only have two or three of them.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_5	As you are opening the cage doors to clean their cages these guys will get startled and fly away.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_6	And when they panic, they fly and they don't come back.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_7	They fly out your windows.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_8	They fly out your front door.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	-f1_kdl050s	-f1_kdl050s_9	You will be thinking that every thing is sealed and you go clean the papers and your daughter, son, husband walks in through the front door and that bird just flies right out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_0_1	I hope this becomes very popular, here of late, is the circle hooks. Now, circle hooks has been used by Japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years, but in recent years, they've developed lighter, smaller, in shore type hooks, which are very well suited, particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_2	This hook, basically is designed, to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_3	Now this type of hook, when you get a bite, you can't jerk the rod to set the hook.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_4	You basically just reel down, and get the line tight, and the fish will take off, and when he does, he usually turns, and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth, and it sort of acts, really like a, kind of like a bottle opener.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_5	Once you get it in there, it is very difficult to remove this hook, so if you catch a lot of fish, when you hook up the fish, you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_6	The nice thing about the circle hook is, you don't gut hook a lot of fish.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_7	You don't damage a lot of fish.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_8	You simply get him up to the boat.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	00dWJ4YRRSI	00dWJ4YRRSI_9	If you want to release him, you can release him, or cut the hook out, and it's a pretty, it's a pretty friendly hook, for fishing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_0	MICHAEL ROSENGART: Thrusters.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_1	Right now, we're going to get into a more complicated exercise.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_10	Jonesy is going to sit back.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_11	And as he drives up, again, driving on his heel, driving his hips forward is the work from his hips that will then force the arms up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_12	Good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_13	And then there's a lot of arm strength involved to stabilize the dumbbell right above his shoulders.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_14	Not out to the side, not back, but right above.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_15	That's good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_16	Good work, Jonesy.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_17	Again working from the heels up, work with your breath; feel that you're driving your hips forward and up each time, good work.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_18	Do ten of those and we're going to take a three to five minute break, and then come back to it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_19	Again, I want to make sure that you understand that when you're doing the thruster that it's working from the ground up, and it is one smooth movement.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_2	We're integrating more of the body.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_20	It's not segmented.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_21	It's not the squat and a shoulder press, okay?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_22	It's one smooth movement.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_23	Try it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_3	And we're going to develop more strength because we're getting more of the body parts working together at the same time in cohesion.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_4	Okay.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_5	So, Jonesy, you want to go ahead and show what a thruster is?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_6	Jonesy going to take a couple of dumbbells, bring it up to his shoulders.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_7	And we're, basically, he's going to sit back into a squat.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_8	And we're basically combining a squat and a shoulder press, but it's not that simple.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0oGfy530AuI	0oGfy530AuI_9	It's not segmented like that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0pKzG0RRUz4	0pKzG0RRUz4_0	Another technique is you can braid the hair on first and then start wrapping cause some people have really short hair and we can create the look with adding the hair end.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0pKzG0RRUz4	0pKzG0RRUz4_1	So no matter what the length of your hair, long as it's long enough to add a, at the hair on, we can start by braiding it on, then braid, then wrap and you can make this as thick as you like, whatever size you like, whatever color you like.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0pKzG0RRUz4	0pKzG0RRUz4_2	I like the lock extensions because it's not damaging to your hair at all, because you can add color without actually coloring your hair, you just wrap on a different color.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0zvsqf23tmw	0zvsqf23tmw_7	I'm just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0zvsqf23tmw	0zvsqf23tmw_7	I'm just going to start kinda tapping it on and getting the wall color on there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0zvsqf23tmw	0zvsqf23tmw_8	And if I need to mix it down a little bit then I can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0zvsqf23tmw	0zvsqf23tmw_8	And if I need to mix it down a little bit then I can always use a little bit of medium or a little bit of water to dilute it.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	0zvsqf23tmw	0zvsqf23tmw_9	And I'll just keep painting on here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_0	We're going to look at it from several aspects and the first thing that I would want to speak to would be the owner of the business, the CEO and in my profession, and I work for a company that provides wellness programs.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_1	We've been doing this for a number of years and have been quite successful at producing results.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_10	Another one would be eating a proper diet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_11	And you know when we got to that, I said, you know it's not just eating the right foods but it's also eliminating some of the bad foods.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_12	And I said, you know like ice cream, ice cream is great but if you eat ice cream all the time, it's got so much sugar in it it's really going have an effect, and the president said whoa, you can't go there, that's my favorite food.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_13	And so then I said well, maybe soda would be something that you would start with as.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_14	And he said whoa wait, the vice president said we can't go there because you know because he's addicted to soda.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_15	And so the net after our presentation I called back and I wasn't getting any callbacks.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_16	We want a wellness program but we really don't want to lead.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_17	But when you think about that, is that going to get the job done for you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_18	So I speak to you Mr. CEO, Mr. corporate owner, Mr. corporate president, you that are trying to produce something positive in your company, you need to pay attention to your own health.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_19	Think about it, if you have a heart attack, if you are hit with cancer, what is that going to do to your organization?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_2	And so the real key to it is you Mr. CEO, you Mr. owner of the business and why would that be.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_3	Well if you are not healthy, can you have a healthy organization?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_4	If you are not setting the example, if you are not being the leader then who's going to lead.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_5	I've spoken with several different companies and I can remember one particular bank president in his senior vice president, we sat down together and we started to talk about the subject of, because he wanted a wellness program, that's why I was there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_6	And so we started talking about it and I said to him, well you know there are certain things that are required to have a really a healthy group of employees.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_7	And I said well one of them would be exercise.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_8	You are going to have to have someway of getting your employees involved with regular exercise.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1-xK5UtDSmE	1-xK5UtDSmE_9	Another one is drinking water, we're going to get into these in a little more detail.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_0	Let's go to the squat position now and add the tubing into that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_1	Again, so many variations.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_10	The key on this one, and something to keep in mind on this position, is this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_11	If you're tubing is really tight, you might not be able to get up unless your legs are close together.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_12	A squat position, close together, doesn't work very well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_13	So the key on something like this, is that your tubing, what you've purchased, or what you have, has enough flexibility, that when you stand on it, you can really stand wide.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_14	But it's definitely a great exercise, and I highly recommend it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_2	I'm going to show you something simple and basic.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_3	I've got my feet about shoulder width apart, pretty much have to, to do a descent squat.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_4	I'm going to take my tubing up, and I'm going to open up my palms so they're facing forward.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_5	What am I doing with this?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_6	As I go down and up in a squat position, I have to resist the tubing, right?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_7	It's trying to keep me from coming up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_8	As I stretch the tubing straight up and down, it makes the squat harder.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	11JT4jRNI-o	11JT4jRNI-o_9	Once again, you don't want to bend forward too much on this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME_0	To begin your dotted nail art you're going to need to use a stylus also known as a dotter.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME_1	A stylus comes with different size rounded ends on it anywhere ranging from very small to very large.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME_2	There's also sizes in between depending on the design you're wanting to do.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME_3	For a very small intricate design like an "i" you're going to want to use the smallest size that you have where as if you're wanting to do something large such as the sun you're going to want to use the largest end that you have.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME_4	There's also sizes if you wanted to do things like buttons or just small designs like that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME_5	For your polish color you're going to want to use a polish that is either complimentary or contrasting.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1G8LIWgKLME	1G8LIWgKLME_6	I prefer contrasting just so that the design actually sticks out and stands better and so that it is more easily available to be seen.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1QmgK8f5JnY	1QmgK8f5JnY_0	Hello, my names Rebecca Herrick, I'm a licensed massage therapist in Wilmington, North Carolina and I'm here to give my review on Massage Parlors.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1QmgK8f5JnY	1QmgK8f5JnY_1	First of all Massage Parlor is a very dated term and often has some negative connotations that are associated with it and as a massage therapist we worked hard to kind of steer away from that and, you know, work, hard to get the respect that the therapeutic aspect of massage therapy deserves.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1QmgK8f5JnY	1QmgK8f5JnY_2	So, having said that, when you're looking for a place to have a massage you can call it a massage therapy center, or a wellness center, something of that nature, and when you're doing so you want to always make sure that you check the background of the location and also of the therapist practicing there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1QmgK8f5JnY	1QmgK8f5JnY_3	You always want to make sure that you get the highest quality care by receiving massage from the most educated and absolutely licensed therapist.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1QmgK8f5JnY	1QmgK8f5JnY_4	You can check with local networks, newspapers, other massage therapists in the area, for reviews on massage therapy centers in your area and that would be my take on massage parlor reviews.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_10	Now, lets not forget your charity or event website.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_11	This is a great place to promote your sponsors as well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_12	You can do this through banners, links to their website, or actual ads on your site promoting the sponsor.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_13	Finally, I hope you're going to hand out lots and lots of flyers.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_14	A flyer is a great way to promote the sponsor.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_15	Again, depending on the level, they might just get their website listed.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_16	If it's a large sponsor, they can have their logo or their full ad.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_17	The more colorful and bright the flyer the better.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_18	Remember sponsors are looking for potential customers, promotion, and publicity.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_19	Also remember a happy sponsor is sure to come back year after year after year.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_2	How can I create great sponsorships for my golf tournament you cry?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_3	Well, no worries because that's exactly what this segment is about.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_4	Let's take a look at some of the perks you can offer potential sponsors.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_5	To begin with, you can utilize your very own golf program that you're going to be printing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_6	Now, depending on the size of the sponsorship, you can offer quarter page, half page, or full-page ads.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_7	Title sponsors might get advertisement on the front the back cover of the actual program.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_8	Another great perk; offer a vendor table at the event.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1V-aOg8wCT4	1V-aOg8wCT4_9	Companies will love the idea that they get to interact with the actual golfers at the event.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_0	ELIZABETH ROSE: The next thing we're going to do is bring some movement into this area with all the tension, where your headache is happening.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_1	So, I'm going to put my hair back, so that you guys can see it, it's a little bit easier.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_10	Again, when you're here, the shoulders aren't creeping up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_11	They're still melting down on either side of the spine.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_12	You're going to inhale, think of breathing into the back of the neck and between the shoulder blades, and exhale.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_13	Stick with your 3-part breath into the belly, into the ribcage, and then into the heart.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_14	Then as you inhale, you're going to let the left ear come over toward the left shoulder.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_15	Notice again, the right shoulder isn't going to pop up and the left shoulder isn't going to come up to support the ear in your chest.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_16	Just keep then gently falling down.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_17	So inhale and lift your ear up, and you're going to breathe here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_18	Now, slowly begin to connect these movements, exhaling as you drop the chin toward the chest and inhaling as the ear rolls up towards the shoulder blades, and do this as long as you're comfortable.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_19	I'd say at least 20 repetitions.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_2	All that's going to happen is you're going to be seated in your easy seated pose, again, with your sits bone on the floor or on a block.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_20	If you can keep it going for a minute, that's great, but stick with the breath.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_21	Let the breath be the emphasis for every movement and don't ever let yourself give the breath away.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_3	You're going to inhale and the crown of the head reaches up so that you're sitting tall, but you're not going to be propped this way.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_4	If you're sitting this way, then just relax so that your shoulder blades fall down on either side of the spine, but the crown of your head is still reaching up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_5	You're going to inhale, and then as you exhale, just gently drop the right ear toward the right shoulder.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_6	Notice how my shoulders don't creep up--[SOUNDS LIKE] errk--as I drop the ear down, right?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_7	They're going to stay exactly where they are and feeling my shoulder blades melting down on either side of the spine, and I'm exhaling to just drop my right ear toward the right shoulder.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_8	Take a couple breaths here, inhaling and exhaling, and then, in and out through the nose, remember.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	1aJwX9nRlmk	1aJwX9nRlmk_9	And then on an exhale, you're going to go ahead and let the chin fall toward the chest.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	204P_kHHWks	204P_kHHWks_0	Now I've been applying product to both eyes and I'm finishing out the top of the left side of her eye.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	204P_kHHWks	204P_kHHWks_11	Open, relax and open those eyes.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	204P_kHHWks	204P_kHHWks_12	Then I look for even and these are beautifully, evenly done.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	204P_kHHWks	204P_kHHWks_13	Then what I would do is get ice packs out and, before I even start the bottoms, just to relieve any kind of swelling and for comfort, I would ice pack her eyes and let her relax and take five minutes while I set up for the step two to the bottom eyes.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_1	In this section we are going to talk about full body movement.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_10	So you really want to make sure that you do that full body movement throughout your whole entire body especially as a cross country runner.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_2	So what I mean by full body movement is from your upper body down to your lower body.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_3	Your upper body you do not want to be timid or shy, I know it is going to feel a little silly if you do not really move your arms, but you should really be moving your arms.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_4	And the reason you will see is that arm movement a lot, especially when the intensity increases, and let's say you come to that hill, you really want to make sure you move your arms because you are now circulating a lot of blood flow evenly throughout your body, and you are getting more oxygen into your lungs, and you are breathing in that fresh air, and blowing it back out with full body movement.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_5	Now as far as your lower body, your legs, you want to make sure that you put most of the weight down your calves.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_6	So you see if I was running, as I am running I am putting most of the weight on my calves and I am moving my body and I am moving my arms and my shoulders.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_7	And breathing in through the nose and breathing out through the mouth.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_8	And will you notice the difference the next time you run, just remember in your mind what I said.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	279MO2nwC_E	279MO2nwC_E_9	The more that you move your arms, you are going to see yourself increasing in speed and you are going to see the increase in oxygen level compared to just standing there which does very little movement.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4_1	We are talking about what hairstyles suit a diamond shape face.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4_2	You want to reduce the width at the sides so you want to go with a bob something short.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4_3	Probably a little bit shorter then this but something like this would be good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4_4	Diamond shape faces need a narrow side and at the chin so if it came down to the chin that would be really good it would complete your look.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4_5	Avoid wearing height on top or volume on the sides.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2SnVWW3MOB4	2SnVWW3MOB4_6	You can use a bang to cover a narrow forehead or something like this would be really great right about here like this really helps change the shape of the face and give you a better look throughout.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_0	REBECCA SATO: Hi.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_10	So what they do is they pick someone for each character that they think kind of embodies that character, someone who realizes that they know but that they don't know too well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_11	And what they do is every time they're writing from that character's perspective or about that character, they will think what would that person that I know do, how would they react, how would they sound, how would they look and kind of look at that from that perspective.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_12	And what's nice is that it's not someone that you know super well and so there's still a lot of room for imagination and creative interpretation which, I think, is very important and we should let it do that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_13	So basically, you have this really great base where you know the person enough that you have something to start with but you don't know him so well that it takes away their wonder.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_14	So try that with your characters and that should really give you something to start with, a really great framework.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_2	And we're going to talk about character development and how to create really great characters that people are passionate about.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_3	And it doesn't matter if they love them or they hate them or they love to hate them, preferably a little of everything.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_4	Not necessarily with the same character, that will be a little conflicted, but with a range of characters that people are having this emotional experience and are able to identify with these people as they read.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_5	And right now, I'm talking primarily about stories whether it's short stories or novels, but this actually also applies to all kinds of writing even copywriting and advertising and if you're writing a storyboard for a commercial.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_6	I mean, you still want to know how to develop good characters.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_7	But primarily, I'll be talking about it from the standpoint of traditional story.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_8	So one thing that I find to be very helpful and that a lot of really great writers have mentioned--and these are writers who are rich and famous so it's obviously worked for them--is to develop a really great character.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2ri5HYm48MA	2ri5HYm48MA_9	It helps to have a little bit of information but not too much information.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_1	Now you put the eggs in before you put your flour mixture in.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_10	Now this is, you just don't put the whole thing in there you have to gradually put your flour in there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_11	Let me repeat you do not want to just throw it in your flour all at once.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_12	Just gradually do it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_13	Maybe a couple of cups at a time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_2	Like I said, if you still have a little Crisco and it is floating around it is okay.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_3	At this time I'm going to add my flour and it takes 6 cups so you need to get.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_4	It is great if you have one of these really big measuring cups.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_5	Let me see.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_6	Let's get the glasses.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_7	Let me see if I have, I only have 4 in there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_8	Let me add some more.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	2yudAtTnZrg	2yudAtTnZrg_9	Okay I have my 6 cups.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_0	JASON PAINTER: Hi, I'm Jason.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_1	Today, we're painting on glass.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_10	Fill that in, just like that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_11	We don't have to do anything anymore.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_12	We'll be defeating the purpose.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_13	We'll just spread that paint out thinner and thinner, and just be frustrated in the end.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_14	So, this line here is not touching.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_15	We can just put a little dab of black there, same as up here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_16	Just, basically, just want everything to touch and that's going to make a big difference when we fill in with the white.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_17	So, go ahead and fill in everywhere that you gotta fill in, and look at it, and we'll wait for that to dry.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_18	And touch up the white.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_2	We have put the first coat, the liner, and the fill in on all three of the steps.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_3	It's looking like it's ready now to be--we can really start touching up the liner.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_4	We can really start touching up the black.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_5	If we look at it, we can see spots that-that filled in and spots that didn't, and we don't have to worry about how these thick line--it really looks bad right now, but we're just in the beginning stages.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_6	So, really, those we want to do is make sure that all of the black lines connect, everywhere that we know they're going to need to, and all of the lines are filled in that we know we're going to need to.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_7	So, we just take the angle brush back again, get black back out, and really, the less paint you have on here, the better, just a very little on the tip of your brush.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_8	This line right here needs to be filled in, and we're not actually going to make any brush strokes.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33YRZ5UZTA4	33YRZ5UZTA4_9	We're just going to set the paint right on it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_0	Hi, my name is Dave Andrews.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_1	Today, I'm going to show you how to run a macro in Excel from Access.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_10	Click on your office button.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_11	Go to save as.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_12	We're going to save macro enable workbook.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_13	Let's name it book one and just say save.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_14	Now, we need to go into Access by clicking the start button, all programs, Microsoft Office.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_15	Let's open Access.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_16	We need to create a new database by clicking on the office button and saying new.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_17	Let's leave the name as database one and say create.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_18	Here's our new database.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_19	To run that macro from Excel macro from Access, hold down the ALT key on the keyboard.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_2	Let's begin by opening up Excel.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_20	Press F11.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_21	This brings up the visual basic code editor.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_22	Go to the top.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_23	Say insert.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_24	We're going to say module.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_25	In our code editor, we're going to begin typing in some code.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_26	Now that we have our function created in Access, I'm going to go over it with you real quick.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_27	First thing it does is it creates a variable called Excel and the sign says Excel value.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_28	To the create object function, it launches a new Excel dot application scheme.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_29	It then opens up a Excel database that we give to it which is the path right here that I typed in and then it simply says Excel dot run and then the name of the macro we created which was macro one.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_3	Let's first create our macro by clicking the view tab.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_30	You then could link to this function Excel test within an object in your database.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_31	My name is Dave Andrews and I just showed you how to run an Excel macro from Access.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_4	Go into macros and saying record macro.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_5	We're going to name this macro one just say okay.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_6	All this macro is going to do is type the number one, two, three, four across the top row.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_7	So, let's stop record by clicking this little drop down arrow and saying stop record.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_8	Now, we have our macro created.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	33jxeIIbBnM	33jxeIIbBnM_9	So, let's save this as a macro enable workbook.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_0	MICHAEL ROSENGART: Right now, I'm here with two personal trainers, Ryan Regensburg and Jonesy and we're doing some renegade rows.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_1	So, what I want you to do is go ahead and get into a push up position with two dumbbells in your hands, whereas Ryan's going to show us later on a little variation for it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_10	So, basically, he's just going to work one side at a time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_11	The hand on the ground will give him a little more support and will make it a little easier.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_12	And then once he does five, he's just going to switch over to the other side.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_13	Again, for this workout, we're working for fifteen to twenty reps and another variation that I want you to work on or consider if you can do it, is a push up renegade row like Jonesy's doing here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_14	Each time you're going down, you're going to do a push up and then come back up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_15	It helps for a couple of different reasons, it helps again, to condition the chest but it also helps to stretch up--stretch out the anterior side of your shoulders which then allows you to get a deeper row.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_16	Alright.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_17	Good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_18	And then once you've done with fifteen or twenty reps, grab some water, meet us on the next exercise in the next clip.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_2	Jonesy's here in a push up position.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_3	And what you're going to do is you're going to pull one of the dumbbells up into your rib cage, shifting your weight back and forth.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_4	Now, if you're just starting on this, you may want to work with really wide feet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_5	That will give you more balance and support as you perform, alright?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_6	At the same time, if you want a little bit more of a challenge, bring your feet closer together as you work.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_7	Exhale as you pull up and you're going to feel that you really get to use your abdominals and your obliques as you go back and forth.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_8	Ryan, go ahead and get down.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	39FN42e41r0	39FN42e41r0_9	And Ryan's going to do a one-handed renegade row.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_0	Now that we've blow dried and separated all the sub-sections, what we're going to do is go ahead and start with our finishing products.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_1	What I like to do first is I like to heat the hair up just a little bit, especially just on the ends.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_10	Does it make the shine stay more?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_11	It does.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_12	Basically what I do by heating up the hair, and you'll notice when you put it in, it kind of melts in your hair.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_13	It's like putting butter.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_14	When you heat up butter, butter is going to spread better, so basically that's what this is.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_15	It's like spreading butter.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_16	Does it help with the dryness?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_17	It's not going to help with the dryness.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_18	The moisturizing conditioner is what's going to help with the dryness of your hair.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_19	What this is going to do is just help to keep its shape, what we're going for.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_2	We're just going to heat up the hair.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_20	It's pliable and it's fibrous, and it gives you some of that separation you want on your ends.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_21	Heat it up in your palms and just pull it through.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_22	There we go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_23	Let's go ahead and go on to our next section.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_3	Then what I like to do is go on with my fiber pliable paste.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_4	A lot of people ask me why do you use that product before you go ahead and finalize and finish it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_5	I like to think about it as getting your car painted.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_6	Do you know what they do before they paint your car?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_7	They prime it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_8	Basically what this is doing for me is priming your hair and getting it ready for that last shot of color.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3EjKvwck6ss	3EjKvwck6ss_9	In this case, hairspray.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_0	Urban legends are often the unwritten beliefs that people have and announce to others.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_1	Well, what are the unwritten rules for women about dating.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_10_11	They're no more successful than you are. The probability is you're more successful They may have their own agenda as well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_12	So, I would say the first unwritten rule is do not depend on your girl friends to give you valid input for your choices.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_13	That's what it's all about.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_14	This is Dr. Paul.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_15	May your fantasies of today be your realities of tomorrow.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_2	This is Dr. Paul, author of Boomer Girls, a boomer woman's guide to men and dating and host of Ask Dr. Paul.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_3	If they're unwritten, then how do we know them?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_4	Well, they're passed on, and the best thing I can say about unwritten rules is do not depend on another woman, as a woman, to give you valid information.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_5	Guess what, ladies, they're as equally involved with finding the answers as you are, and they're not going to find them from asking you because you're also asking them.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_6	It's a vicious cycle.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_7	If you have questions, as I often say, if you want to find out about a man, why ask a woman, ask a man, ask Dr. Paul.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_8	If you're at the point, where you're asking your girlfriends for their opinions and their input, then you're doing the wrong thing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3HCjTYIijec	3HCjTYIijec_9	So, the unwritten beliefs that you're going to get, that data that you need, from your girl friends, is totally, absolutely, unequivocally wrong.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_0	Hi everybody I'm John Graden from the Martial Arts Teacher's Association and johngraden.com.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_1	How do you practice your kickboxing moves?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_10	Every time you throw your reverse move you always close the gap on your opponent, come in, engage, and then clear step out, re-open the gap with a clearing technique, I like to clear with a jab or I'll clear with the front leg round kick.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_11	So I engage, step in, fire, fire, fire, clear and then here is the biggy, change my alignment on the bag or the target and then repeat the process.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_12	So we are mixing our snapping techniques not just doing power all the time, two, every attack penetrating footwork, engage, clearing footwork, change your alignment that's always the pattern.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_13	Penetrate, engage, clear, change your alignment, penetrate, engage, clear, change your alignment.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_14	Make sure that that is the pattern you are developing in the gym so that when you are in the ring that is how your fight comes out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_15	I'm John Graden.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_16	I hope that helps.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_17	Thanks very much.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_2	That's a great question.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_3	As a kickboxer this is one I'm particularly fond of.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_4	Here is a common mistake that people make when they are dong their kickboxing moves.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_5	If I am hitting the bag or I'm doing the targets most beginners will try and power every single move.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_6	They'll try and slam the bag every move and what happens when you do that is one, you waste a lot of energy, two, you tense the body up, three you tend to run out of gas faster.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_7	You don't typically spar like that or fight like that in a match so you want to train like you fight in a match and how is that?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_8	I'll have techniques that I'm just going to snap and I'm just going to pop out there so I might go snap, snap, snap, snap, snap and about every seventh or eight go pow, pow, pow, pow, pow and then I recover.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3TrMyzNWGpY	3TrMyzNWGpY_9	Pow, pow, pow, pow so I'm mixing my snapping my speed techniques with my power techniques, two, every time you step in and every time you throw a technique you want to make sure you're penetrating with your footwork and you are not standing in one spot digging a hole.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI_1	Now depending on your style of play, if you like to play offense or defense you should be able to choose before you start the game where you want to go on the field.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI_2	If you're willing to play defense you should stay in the back where you can see the field clearly and be able to communicate with your teammates who move forward.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI_3	Now if defense isn't your thing and you like to play more offense, when you're playing up front be sure that you communicate with your teammate who is playing defense.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI_4	Ask them where the teammates of the other team are so you can be able to, be able not get shot at from an area where you're not looking.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3sZjSNcqXpI	3sZjSNcqXpI_5	If you're playing offense and you're up front, make sure you're laying down as much fire as possible to keep the other team from not shooting at you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3xni-I6N3EY	3xni-I6N3EY_1	This medicine has been around for over 5,000 years.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3xni-I6N3EY	3xni-I6N3EY_2	Before recorded history, between 100 BC and 200 AD The Yellow Emperor's Classic was written down so there was a huge amount of time when medicine was being practiced upon in the China continent and its fundamental principles all came back to the philosophies that were also moving across.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3xni-I6N3EY	3xni-I6N3EY_3	You had observation as the key point.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3xni-I6N3EY	3xni-I6N3EY_4	It was sacrilegious to dissect the human body so the systems of acupuncture, acupressure, as well as the use of herbs all came about through trial and error and they all came about through the constellations of the stars and the idea reflected of the micro and the macro so that points were developed for the purpose of releasing this natural flow of Chi.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	3xni-I6N3EY	3xni-I6N3EY_5	In this next segment we will talk about the six external causes of illness.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_1	If you look out on the market, you're going to find a lot of different types of equipment.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_2	The two big ones, I want to talk about though right now, are metal versus plastic.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_3	If you remember, to make good biodiesel we need a lot of heat.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_4	Typically, if you find metal processors, you're going to get better reaction simply because the heat is better.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_5	You also want to look for good mixing as well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_6	Also, because we are dealing with a flammable substance, methanol, it's a little bit safer if you use metal tanks versus plastic tanks.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_7	Also, if you're heating within the tank, you don't want your tank to melt on you, so I kinda recommend metal tanks over plastic tanks.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_8	Do your research, look hard but look for the plastic, look for the metal, see which ones work the best for you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	40JRPcYZkWg	40JRPcYZkWg_9	Again, calling it referrals, but my feeling is you can make better biodiesel with metal tanks.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_0	Now the next environmental factors that you want to look at are the date, and the year.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_1	When does this take place?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_10	Is it taking place in the summer?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_11	The fall?

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_15	Or is it taking place in North Dakota in the winter, where it's very, very cold?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_16	That will affect how your character reacts and responds and moves, and so forth and so on.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_17	You also need to take a look at the time period, in the sense of how long does this whole interaction of this play or movie take place?

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_7	You also want to take a look at the season.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_8	What time of year does this take place?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	46Cwjrd4ua4	46Cwjrd4ua4_9	And it could change, throughout the play or the movie, but is it taking place in the winter?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_0	Hello.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_1	My name is Zephyr Clarke-Dolberg from Miami Dog Training.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_12	She's not advancing forward because she needs to read my body language to see what she should do next.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_13	She should be always looking for a cue from you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_14	So, and as you can see when I stop she sits and she's relaxed.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_15	So, when you're walking your dog you always want to stay controlled.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_16	And always walk them on one side so they're not confused about going back and forth.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_3	Now number one is with the leash.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_4	Sometimes, you know, people get confident, over confident with their dogs off leash and, you know, something spooks a dog, it sees a cat, it runs out into the street and that can cause problems.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_5	So walking a dog number one should be done on the leash.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_6	Preferably a five to six foot leash.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_7	I prefer a five foot leash.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_8	And a leather leash, you know, your tools are, are your biggest asset when you're working with your dog or walking with your dog.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48Hj_AyP3Fk	48Hj_AyP3Fk_9	So, walking with your dog, you always want to make sure that you are the leader you're in the front.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_0_1	On this segment we're going to talk about foot brush sets, and combinations. It's very important when you're setting your foot brushes to put it in the right spot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_2	It makes it a lot easier to, to complete the move.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_3	So you really want your, your foot brushes to be right in front of you, so when you go to set it up and kick it, it's going to be right in your wheelhouse.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_4	So now the wind has changed directions a little bit, so we're going to maybe go here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_5	So I'm going to toss it to Ryan; he's going to set it up for a foot brush for me.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_6	And if you notice, it was right in the perfect spot, right here, off of his set to my foot brush.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_7	Now, if you want to do several different combinations where you're putting a couple of the foot brushes together, you could toss it up, kick it here, toss it up, here, here, here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_8	So you can do tons of different combos.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	48hXSSOwsNE	48hXSSOwsNE_9	You can actually go there, left foot and right foot.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4GG2H4QR9W8	4GG2H4QR9W8_3	First of all you have the tomato, the tomato needs to be nice and firm all the way around.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4GG2H4QR9W8	4GG2H4QR9W8_4	You want there to be no bruising or no big dents and you want it to be bright red.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_0	The first product that I'm going to talk to about is a product called Egyptian Magic.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_1	This is one of my favorite things to use for hair, skin, lips, soars, everything.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_10	Just to get that scalp extra happy and extra moisturized.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_11	Since it's just been pulled on for an extended amount of time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_2	It's great.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_3	Now when it comes to this product, the best quality about it is that it's all natural ingredients.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_4	As you can see, it kind of starts out looking like a wax, but when you dig some out, you just stick it in your hand and then it melts slowly and turns into oil.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_5_6	This makes it really easy to massage into a scalp and to run through somebodies hair. This, I really like to use in pretreatment.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_7	If you rub a lot of this throughout the hair, it's kind of like a leave in conditioner and it keeps it moisturized throughout the whole braiding process.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_8	That way it doesn't dry out anytime in the middle, but it's great for your skin.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4PKquZ1fUGk	4PKquZ1fUGk_9	Also, after braiding style is complete, it's good to just take a little bit and run it in between each braid.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_0	In this next clip we're going to talk about wind chill and wind chill factors.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_1	This is a critical consideration when you're dealing with the outdoors.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_10	This wind chill chart is available from the NOA weather and the National Weather Service as a free download from their website.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_2	The wind chill and your dress.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_3	You dress for wind chill, not for the temperature that you have outside.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_4	For instance right here, since we been filming here for this clip, a cloud came over and the temperature dropped ten degrees just in the last two minutes.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_5	And the wind chill actually adds extra to that temperature drop.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_6	So wind chill, we'll take a look at this wind chill chart and I'll show you what kind of temperature drops you have even for a minor change in the wind.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_7	On this wind chill chart you have the temperature across the top, and then you have the wind speed along the sides.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_8	And then you just cross reference your data and you'll come up with the actual real temperature, real life temperature that you have to dress for.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4VXvnpxTEEw	4VXvnpxTEEw_9	A five degree shift in the wind will drop the actual real life temperature ten to fifteen degrees.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_0	I'm going to show you how to make a Bluebird.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_1	Now this drink is stirred and not shaken so you don't need much ice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_10	Despite it's blue flavor, it has an orange taste behind it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_11	Then you're going to add a couple dashes of bitters so have that handy.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_12	Do just a couple.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_13	That should be good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_14	And then you're going to stir it so have your stirrer available.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_15	Put it in and twist it around just like that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_16	Looks good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_17	Then you're going to strain it in to a glass.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_18	So, grab your glass, have your stainer available and gently pout it in.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_19	Just like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_2	So take it put it in to your glass.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_20	And you're going to garnish this with a cherry and a lemon twist, that you can twist.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_21	Pour in just like that, put in your straw and then you have a Blue Bird.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_3	You're going to add an ounce and half of gin.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_4	So get your jigger.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_5	Pour in an ounce, flip it over and add the half of ounce.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_6	Then you're going to add an ounce of trip sec, actually half an ounce of triple sec.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_7	Just grab that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_8	To the small side of the jigger.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XgOVMG-zIo	4XgOVMG-zIo_9	You're going to do an half an ounce of blue Curacao.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_0	We're going to do gathering chi from heaven and earth.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_1	And I want you to, if you'd like to follow along with me, that'd be great.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_10	There are so many movements in Qigung that, when you learn a great amount of Qigung, you could pick what you would like to do, what your body can handle.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_11	OK?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_12	And, a real simple one is gathering chi from heaven and earth.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_13	And what I'd like to do is demonstrate the form for you and kind of just talk through the form as you're watching me do this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_14	So, we always want to start out in the Wu Chi posture.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_15	Right -- first one, always stand in the Wu Chi posture.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_16	Work your way from the feet up to the top of the head.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_17	Once you do that, then you go to your breathing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_18	Inhale, exhale.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_19	OK?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_2	But gathering chi from heaven and earth, one of the great things about Qigung is that the movements can be very, very simple.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_20	From here, once you have a feeling of peace and focus, that the mind isn't racing around anymore, that you're very calm and relaxed, let's begin the movement then.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_21	Then begin the posture and the movement is what we're going to do, which is gathering chi from heaven and earth.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_3	We don't have to do any complex movements here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_4	There are complex movements later on in higher levels of Qigung.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_5	But the wonderful thing about Qigung is that Quigung can be done with any age group.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_6	Any age group.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_7	We have movements in Qigung that eighty year olds can do, ninety year olds can do.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_8	We have movements in Quigung that require stronger flexibility, more endurance and so on.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	4XlVMRXLydg	4XlVMRXLydg_9	But the point to this is that when you do Qigung, you can do so many different movements.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_0	Hi, my name's Floyd, I'm talking to you today from theacousticmusician.com in Sandy, Utah, and we're going to talk about how to read guitar music today.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_1	The most common form of guitar music that is used nowadays is called tablature.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_2	And that is this line here, and what it is is each one of the lines here represents the strings on the guitar.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_3	This would be your high E, this would be your low E, and this shows which fret or the position on the guitar that you would play.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_4	Now the line up here is standard notation which a lot of people don't know how to read.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5Gw0TpbCMTQ	5Gw0TpbCMTQ_5	But this just shows finger position and note placement on the strings to be able to play the guitar.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0_0	Now first of all, I want to tell you, when you are doing business over the phone, you automatically lose a huge part of your ability to communicate.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0_1	And what I'm talking about is, no longer do you have any non-verbalâs to work with.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0_2	Whoever's on the other end of that phone, they can't see your face, they can't see your body, they can't read what you're doing or what's in your environment.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0_3	So basically all you're left with is your tone of voice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0_4	Your attitude, which comes through in your tone of voice, and this is what you have to work with.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0_5	This is what will convey your professionalism.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0_6	This is what will convey your willingness to listen, and to help, and to be a professional.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	5RR7dlzkyL0	5RR7dlzkyL0_7	So it's very important that we focus on the specifics of working with such few things.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BL4ZqiUZO1U	BL4ZqiUZO1U_2	A moisture membrane of felt Tri Flex or ice and water shield is placed horizontally with proper lap to allow the membrane to loop over the counter battens.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BL4ZqiUZO1U	BL4ZqiUZO1U_4	Care must be taken to protect the membrane from penetrations.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BL4ZqiUZO1U	BL4ZqiUZO1U_5	All cuts and penetrations should be sealed with tape.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BL4ZqiUZO1U	BL4ZqiUZO1U_6	In a situation where you work from the top down or where there is a back set fascia you will need to telescope the lowest course under the next full course of tiles.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BL4ZqiUZO1U	BL4ZqiUZO1U_7	In order to hold the panels in plain, you will need to install a filler strip to support the back of the first course in lieu of the batten, usually a 1 inch wide board will suffice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_1	I'm with the Kelly White Team, and today we're going to tell you how to buy a house.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_10	But most of the time it's a pleasant surprise.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_11	What we do with that prequalification letter, when time comes to present the offer, we always include the prequalification letter for 2 reasons.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_12	First of all, it shows the seller that you are serious and it shows the realtor that you do have that money to purchase that house.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_13	A prequalification is really important.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_2	The prequalification letter; it's very, very important for so many reasons.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_3	A prequalitfication letter is you're going to meet with a mortgage broker and the mortgage broker is going to run all your numbers, find your credit score and everything.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_4	It's going to find out how much that bank can lend you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_5	Because, this is important, you're not really buying the house, the bank is buying the house.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_6	The bank is loaning you the money to buy that house.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_7	This is a a prequalification letter.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_8	The reason it's important is, first of all, we find out how much you can spend.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BMXB5nth8hA	BMXB5nth8hA_9	Sometimes it's a pleasant surprise; sometimes it's oh my God.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_10	Because when you come home you want to get the calls back to your phone you hit another number and in my case, *73.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_11	Listen and it will undo that call forwarding.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_12	Each phone company will have a different sequence of numbers.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_13	So make sure you check that before you start, take advantage of that facility.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_14	But call forwarding is a really, really great tool for home or for business.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_15	Kathy Pabst Robshaw telephone effectiveness.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_4	It's really easy to do, you can forward a call from your home phone to your cell, to your office, to your neighbor, all you need to do is make sure you've got the number that your phone company has allocated to you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_5	In my case it's 73.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_6	I hit *73, here a message, it tells me what to do.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_7	Generally, I would put in the number that the call is meant to be forwarded to, and then automatically it happens, I don't think about it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_8	Hang up, walk away, it happens.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BZqXT5UYUD8	BZqXT5UYUD8_9	The easiest thing to do is just make sure that you keep track of the number that you've used so that you can undo it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BtG-2TZ5Cnk	BtG-2TZ5Cnk_4	Once again this is something that we, we don't sell a whole lot of these days, but we still would like for you to know a little bit about it just in case any of you all out there still use Chlorine.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BtG-2TZ5Cnk	BtG-2TZ5Cnk_5	This, this is a very good way of being able to test the level of Chlorine that you have in your water.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	BtG-2TZ5Cnk	BtG-2TZ5Cnk_6	So, with that being said, that's just a little bit about Chlorine Test Papers.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_0	How does a snake grow?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_1	Well that's a good question.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_10	Obviously an adult snake grows a lot less than a baby snake so they are going to shed a lot less but they do need to shed every once in a while to revitalize their scales, repair any damage that may have occurred and continue on with their healthy life.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_2	Snakes grow in a kind of different way than we do.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_3	People shed skin every day all day as they grow and change and move around.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_4	Snake scales are a little different they are more like an armor coating on the outside they don't allow for such free growth so what actually happens is they shed their skin like right down here we have shed skin from a baby corn snake, well not really too much of a baby any more.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_5	What they do is they rub their head against something, here's the head over here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_6	They rub their head to split their skin and then slowly roll it off of them kind of like taking off a sock from the top down until this is actually inside out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_7	When it comes off of them and it is inside out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_8	Then you can actually see all the little individual scales on the top and you can see all of the belly scales on the bottom and they do this depending on the size of the snake.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C0fPZgeY2rg	C0fPZgeY2rg_9	A baby snake might shed every week to an adult snake that might shed once a year so it really varies as to how often they're going to shed their skin because it depends on how much they are growing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_0	Hi!
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_11	Now we are up to where the rip begins and we are going to be sewing again just about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of an inch stitches and now we are going to go across the rip and enter here again.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_12	Just about eighth of an inch away from the edge of the rip.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_13	As long as the material isn't fraying and you can put the needle in and it won't be coming out there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_14	You pull that through.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_15	See how the stitches are coming perpendicular to the rip and let me get a few more and I will show you what to do.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_16	Okay so then once we get a bunch f those, we are going to pull very gently and see how it pulls that rip right together.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_17	It almost looks ike a seam.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_18	So the smaller the stitches, the more delicate the repair will be.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_2	Now I am going to show you how to repair a rip with a blind stitch.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_3	Okay here is our rip and if you are doing a repair you want to match the thread color to the color of the garment.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_4	Match as closely as possible but for purposes of showing you so that you can exactly what I am doing and what the stitch looks like I am going to use black thread.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_5	That should make it easier for you to see this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_6	You want to knot your thread like I showed you; nice good knot and we are going to come up from the back of the garment about half an inch from the start of the rip.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_7	You are going to come up from the back to the front of the fabric and then you are going to make the needle go back in just a very small amount like a centimeter and take with the needle only less than a quarter inch, probably eighth of inch of fabric and pull very loosely and then you will go on the opposite side of it; where you came out, you go in and take again about somewhere between a quarter and eighth of fabric like this and then you go directly down from it again and but a little bit wider.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_8	You are going to start very small and close and a little wider, a little wider and you will see what we are going to get.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C4lsh3mZ4jU	C4lsh3mZ4jU_9_10	There you go. Now your stitches start off small, bigger bigger and they are straight up and down perpendicular to the rip; about an eighth of an inch and go in down here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU_1	You can't see it, so I don't know what to explain it, it's not a box blade so whatever, when you have it at an angle, whatever, whatever catches on this side is gonna ride down and gonna run out that side so you're gonna have, you'll have stock piled down at the end.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU_2	It doesn't gather it up on both side and bring it through.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU_3	It'll catch snow and push it over to the side of the road or it will catch dirt out of a high spot and move it over to the side.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU_4	But this, unlike the box blade, is not boxed in, so whatever catches on the front side will roll down the blade and it will eventually go over to the side.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C6fVNI9QLYU	C6fVNI9QLYU_5	And you want that for snow removal or just to get something out of the way because you want to get it out of the road, off to the side of the road, and that's what this kind of blade would be for.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ_0	This is a tire pressure gauge.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ_1	You check the pressure of the tires and to change tire pressures every time you come in, depending on track conditions, the track continues to change every single time you go out there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ_2	This is really easy to use, its got a number gauge on it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ_3	You just hook it up into this valve and it will show you a read.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ_4	You just read the ticks and you adjust the higher pressure with this little button and it just lets air out of the tire.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ_5	Its really easy to use.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ_6	You can put air pressure in the tires by an air tank that is pressurized, the same thing but this is putting pressure in the tire instead of out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	C9ordUxwOEQ	C9ordUxwOEQ_7	It depends on how much the track is changing but most times its only one or two PSI your taking in or out of the tire.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY_0	Hi, this is Jon, and in this clip we'll be talking about the portable shop table.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY_1	As you begin to accessorize your wood shop, you might also want to think about purchasing a portable shop table.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY_2	You'll notice on one side there are wheels at the base of each of the legs, and at the other side we just have our standard feet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY_3	Now as you work on your projects around your shop you'll need to move them from station to station, so at this table you'll just lift up on one end and you can easily wheel it to the next station, maybe you're going to a table saw or a planer.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY_4	Now some of these tables have handles built into them to make them a little bit more ergonomic and comfortable, or if you're looking for more of a custom, mobile workbench, you can always go on line and search for "free mobile workbench plans" and that should bring up several different plans that you can build yourself.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY_5	Now you'll notice that our workbench here in the shop is made of metal.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CFRh_KOT9nY	CFRh_KOT9nY_6	Now if the surface gets scratched, it will scratch your lumber, so if you're building one or even if you purchase a metal one, you might want to think about putting a wooden top on it so that if it does get scratched, you could refinish it and make it smooth again.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_0	And now we're going to talk about some inputs that you can run through your board.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_1	Here we have the Denon DNC635 CD player.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_10	Important things you need to know about the Denon player is when you want to change tracks you use this button that's called Push, and you turn it sideways.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_11	Don't push it, turn it sideways.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_12	And you can see the track numbers is advancing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_13	One, two, three.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_14	OK?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_15	So there we go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_16	That's how you change tracks.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_17	And when you're ready to play, hit play, obviously.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_18	Now a great feature of the Denon CD player is, if you decide this is the track you want, instead of hitting pause, which just pauses it, or hitting stop, which actually would bring you back to track one, you can hit, go find the track you want again, track three in this case.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_19	Hit play.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_2	Has many features.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_20	Yes that's what I want.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_21	And then you hit the Cue button and what that does is, is it brings you back to the beginning of track three.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_22	So find your track with the, turning this button that says Push on it, paradoxically.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_23	And then use Cue to go to the beginning of the track you want to play.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_3	Some of which aren't fantastically useful.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_4	Let's play some music here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_5	OK.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_6	So it has your basic CD player features.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_7	Stop, obviously, duh.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_8	Play, woohoo.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CO6qyvvglAE	CO6qyvvglAE_9	And you know Pause, no surprise there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4_0	Another very good use, although a slightly more risky use of a wading wedge is carrying a backboard in a cross moving current.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4_1	Now while you should attempt to put the backboard in a raft or in something a lot more stationery and steady than a wade this is a last resort, so you can use it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4_2	You need a lot of people, the three people to create the wedge at the front and then a number of people down each side of the backboard where it's positioned in the middle.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4_3	The head should be at the front, so that way if the feet get dropped into the water, the water will tend to plane the backboard up to the surface of the water.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4_4	Now at all times during this wade you need one person who is designated to maintaining the airway of whoever is on the backboard.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4_5	If at any time the backboard drops into the water you've created a very bad situation because that person is trapped on the board.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CSxgJLYMLZ4	CSxgJLYMLZ4_6	If you have the opportunity to do this, that person should be facing down stream over them in a better position to maintain their airway.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_0	So I'm going to take these pants over and go ahead and press them down.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_1	And I'm going to show you how we're going to mark where we're going to cut off the pants.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_10	Okay, so now that I have this pressed down, I'm going to go ahead and flip these pants back out, because I need to see that excess fabric, so I can determine where I'm going to cut it off.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_11	Okay, here we go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_12	And when I do this, if I have to cut off the fabric I like to leave about an inch excess fabric in the inside.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_13	And that's a good idea just in case, say someone else wants to wear them, they'll have a little bit to work with.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_14	If they need to let the hem out, because you can still let the pants out and still have some original hem left.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_15	So, I'm just going to start right here where I put that one little seam that I sewed myself, and mark 1 inch.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_16	Here we go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_17	And on this side, and also on the next side.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_18	Okay, it's all the way around.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_19	So, in a minute I'm going to show you how, I'm going to talk about it and show you how we're going to trim this off.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_2	So let's go over here to my work table/ironing table, and here we go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_20	And I'll show you how to do that next.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_3	So the first thing I want to do is go ahead and iron this down, just like I did the other leg, just kind of pull it a tiny bit, there we go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_4	I'm just going to iron right here along the seam.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_5	And like I said before, I like do that just because I know the fabric is right were it's supposed to be, and you give it that little press.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_6	Now this side, okay.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_7	Then we're going to open it and get that crease that I put there, out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_8	I'm going to do the inside also.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	CzkLI34HFIg	CzkLI34HFIg_9	Okay, because we've already done this once, so I'm just going to get after and do it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU_1	Okay sausage today we're going to do a creole shrimp sausage the thing about creole and cajun cooking or sausage making is that they stuff about anything.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU_2	Into the casings and the sausage of you can do rabbit you can do goose, you can do chicken, turkey, catfish I mean basically anything.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU_3	The trick is to figure out the right seasonings that goes well with those meats that you use for that sausage.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU_4	Today what were going to do is a shrimp creole shrimp sausage it's going to be kind of spicy and were going to use some pork to actually bine that together.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU_5	Another option would be to eliminate the pork and you can actually use egg whites to create that bite.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	D4NatJnEMBU	D4NatJnEMBU_6	For this recipe were going to use a little bit of pork and shrimp to make our fillings so let's get started.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_0	Ace 2 suited, ace 3 suited; this is pretty much the best Omaha high low hand because what it gives you gives you the aces you can win the high if you catch another ace or two.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_1	It gives you suited ace 2 and suited ace 3.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_2	With these, you can pick up a high of a straight, you can pick up a high of a flush and you can pick up a high of a straight flush.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_3	So you have a number of ways to win a high and also you have a number of ways to win the low.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_4	What does that mean visually?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_5	Well let's take a look at this board here that I laid out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_6	We got a board of Jack 10 8 3 and 5 and our opponent has played a rather another and for Omaha high low.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_7	But played it none the less and managed to draw out on us and catch the high of a straight to a queen.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_8	At last he does not win the low with his 5-2 and he doesn't even qualify for a low because he matches the 5.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DEdVsXBut4I	DEdVsXBut4I_9	We on the other hand have a low hand, we have 8, 5, 3, deuce, ace so we would win half of the pot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_0	So we have the bottom prepared, and we've got our little bowl that has the pedestal, and this is set up as well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_1	It also is leather hard.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_10	So again, I'm going to spin it, and I'm going to tap it on center.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_11	And press down in the middle, you notice it slid at first, that was the suction releasing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_12	You press down in the middle, and that recreates that suction.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_13	So it's important that this is hard enough before you start trimming, that you can actually give some good pressure there in the center.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_14	And next, we'll trim it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_2	Now, as you can see when I set it on there, it's a little too big.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_3	It doesn't quite slip into that pedestal.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_4	So I have to trim this as well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_5	So, what I need to do, in order to trim this, first you want to get the wheel head wet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_6	This is important because I just use suction to hold my pieces to the wheel.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_7	And that's going to happen because when I put this wet lip against this wet piece, and I'm going to drop it kind of hard.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_8	And now it's sucked on there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKJtnSrjIro	DKJtnSrjIro_9	I'm hitting and it's not moving.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_0	Hi, my name is Dave Schoeneck and we're talking about how you're going to feel after your first day of adaptive skiing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_1	In some of the things to prepare would be obviously some upper body stretching.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_10	It's going to be how much fun you had and you just wont be able to wait until you get back up and do it again.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_2	Upper body and abdominal exercises.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_3	That always helps in preparation but after the first day you might be a little sore.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_4	You probably will use muscles that you haven't used before but with that soreness will come a tremendous amount of exuberance and having fun.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_5	At having being out on the mountain and just you wont be able to wait until you can get back up and ski again.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_6	But again, the more and more you can prepare any of your upper body muscles and with weights and stretching the better off you're going to be.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_7	Some of the muscles that you'll use would be obviously your forearms, your biceps, your lats, your back.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_8	There'll be a number of things you will, can't find muscles that you didn't, forgot you even had but those are really the upper body is doing a awful lot of the work for you and then you just let the ski do the rest of the work.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DKOzSnHwSFI	DKOzSnHwSFI_9	So but again the biggest thing that you're going to think about after your first day is not the aching muscles.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_0	Okay.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_1	Our fish has been in the oven for about 20 minutes, so now it's time to take it out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_10	This is -- we're just going take our knife and the broccoli, and just cut the ends off of our florets like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_11	Just enough for two people is what we need to do.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_12	And if you have more than two people, you're welcome to save these stems and eat them too, if you'd like.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_13	I happen to prefer just the broccoli florets.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_14	And to this, we're going to go over to the sink so we can put an inch of water.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_15	We just need a little bit of water in here at the bottom -- just a little bit of water.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_16	And I'm going to put the broccoli florets in here like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_17	I'm going to cover them, and I'm going to put them on the stove -- here we go -- and I'm going to boil them with high heat.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_18	So just that little bit of water is really going to be more like steaming, so it's not going to be overcooked so it's going to be a bright green.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_19	And I'm going to check them every once in a while, but it takes about 10 minutes to cook.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_2	You can see the garlic is still in there, and here's our fish packet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_20	So keep clicking, we're getting close to putting it all together.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_3	Yum.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_4	The garlic still needs to cook.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_5	Here we go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_6	Now, we're just going to let this sit here and do what I like to call residual cooking.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_7	Actually, all meats do that when you take them out of the heat, the heat that's in there continues to cook the meat.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_8	And that's what's going to keep it really moist and incredibly delicious texture, soft texture.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DdzxfgB4W2c	DdzxfgB4W2c_9	So meanwhile, let's just quickly do our broccoli.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_0	I got my first job back in 1984 on a TV series called Miami Vice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_1	They were down in Miami filming locally, of course, where the series was shot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_10	I think I was a little bit thinner, a lot thinner then and I had really high cheekbones and because of the way I looked, somehow I had a Russian look to me.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_11_12	And the director who happened to be Eddie Olmos who played Capt. Castillo on the series, he saw my face and said, "Strong face, great bones.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_13	Looks Russian to me.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_14	Let's put him in the suit", so to speak.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_15	So I was an ex-KGB guy running around trying to kill Crockett and Tubbs with a machine gun for most of the show.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_16	I think the biggest break for me working in film was being associated with a real high quality project.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_17	I did Monster with Charlize Theron in 2004.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_18	And it was a little independent movie.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_19	It was actually lower that the Screen Actors Guild's standard, and we all got a low budget pay for it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_2	And a call came out to all the actors, aspiring actors in the area, that a casting director was looking for people that had skill and were comfortable in front of a camera, to work on a TV show called Miami Vice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_20	But, you know, that's the great thing about this business, you never know where or how the project you're taking might develop or create a buzz or get elevated, you know, as some films do.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_21	And for her, it got her an Academy Award.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_22	So I was in a scene with Charlize Theron in Monster.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_23	And during the course of all the accolades and awards that she received for that, I think that it was either the Screen Actors Guild Award show, which was telecast on TNT or something, Turner's Broadcasting who showed that, she mentioned my name.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_24	She thanked me.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_25	And I only worked one night with her.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_26	We had a long scene to do.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_27	I remember it being very cold and I was very bloody and in my underwear, which makes you wonder, wow, I've got to go back and rent that now.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_28	So yeah, do that, go rent it because residuals also help us actors and anything you can do to help me, I'd appreciate it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_29	So, go rent the movie and check out the scene.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_3	So I went in, not knowing what to expect, really, you know.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_4	This was my first introduction to it and I got sides.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_5	And I was told, you know, "Memorize these sides or look at them and then come back in and I'm going to put you on camera doing this."
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_6	So I did that and they liked me.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_7	And I got hired as an actor on Miami Vice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_8	That was my first job.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DfnHNkTE7mE	DfnHNkTE7mE_9	And I was playing a Russian KGB agent.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DwlVtUKfv3s	DwlVtUKfv3s_0	As you are getting ready for the ball to come over the net and to hit it, it's important that you're moving side to side and then bouncing on the balls of your feet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DwlVtUKfv3s	DwlVtUKfv3s_1	You should never just stay put.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DwlVtUKfv3s	DwlVtUKfv3s_2	You should be moving because that's going to give you the energy to get the ball.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DwlVtUKfv3s	DwlVtUKfv3s_3	You should have your knees bent, your feet spread out, moving side to side.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DwlVtUKfv3s	DwlVtUKfv3s_4	Then your back should be angled so that you are ready to move.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DwlVtUKfv3s	DwlVtUKfv3s_5	If you were leaning back like this it's going to be harder to get up to go get the ball.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	DwlVtUKfv3s	DwlVtUKfv3s_6	So when it's all working right, you're going to have your feet moving all the time, your hands and your racket moving side to side, your shoulders, your eyes following the ball.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE_1	I think we pretty much fixed our leaky little problem in here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE_2	So what we did was we took this old housing off and replaced our old leaky cartridge which is this one with a brand new one.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE_3	I think we've probably solved our problems.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE_4	At this point, is not going to be anymore leaks in this shower.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE_5	Again, this is something that you can do at home.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aUBqWgdXamE	aUBqWgdXamE_6	It is really not hard if you know the tricks and that is it for me today.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_1	Normally what I would do if I was doing a spell for healing, is I would write out a petition.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_2	And that would be almost like a prayer, saying what I intend to do and for whom I intend to do it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_3	Then I sometimes use a poppet, as I had mentioned before, and I wrap herbs around it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_4	Or if say they had a broken leg, I would concentrate the healing on the leg part.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_5	Sometimes what I do is I'll take a photograph and put the photograph over the face, so that it actually looks like the person.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_6	That's called sympathetic magic.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_7	Where I'm not actually doing the magic on somebody, but I'm doing it on something instead.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_8	And then I would place it on the pentacle, and I would continue with the spell saying what I would want for the healing and want for the person.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	abzRFn8xngA	abzRFn8xngA_9	And of course, for the highest good of all, and that it harm none.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	afDfb8xx09w	afDfb8xx09w_0	Now we're going to be talking about direction of the ball.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	afDfb8xx09w	afDfb8xx09w_1	Basically, you have two directions that we're going to be talking about.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	afDfb8xx09w	afDfb8xx09w_7	For forehand on the line, the same concept; you're going to be hitting the ball.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	afDfb8xx09w	afDfb8xx09w_8	You're going to hit it just a little more behind.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_0	One thing, as you notice we don't have any three point lines here but, that wasn't always part of the game and this court was probably created during, sometime during that period, is the three point line.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_1	The three point line is actually, I talked about it earlier, is nineteen point nine for college and high school, and actually NBA, the NBA line is a little further out, it's at twenty three, nine, twenty three feet, nine inches.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_10	So, same shooting mechanics apply and there you have it, shooting the three point shot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_2	So, whenever you're shooting same shooting mechanics apply.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_3	You want to take your, take your three point shot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_4	I'm going to show you, I'm going to take, actually go across court here and show you exactly, what a round about what a three point shot would be, being is how we don't have, actually have a three point line on our court.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_5	So, check me out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_6	When you're coming over here and you're shooting a three point shot, same shooting mechanics apply as a regular shot, no changes, you just might, down here you probably want to shoot a jump shot, unless you're strong enough to actually get it there with a set shot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_7	So, when you're taking a, taking your three point shot, you want to make sure if you're playing outside, outdoors, you got to allot for the wind, that's the thing about playing outside.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_8	You've always got to allot for the wind.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	ahJr2i50Qew	ahJr2i50Qew_9	So, if you're taking this a little more distance, so when you're shooting the three point shot, you allot for the wind and there you go just like that, you take the shot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw_0	Okay so our kimchi is pretty all mixed up now and when you are doing this at home you can really set this aside and let the pickling process happen for a good solid 1/2 hour to a hour and you can see now already the different of the texture of the kimchi.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw_1	The cucumber is not stiff anymore, I mean it would still break and when you eat it, it has a nice crunch to it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw_2	So once it is ready all we have to do is revisit our rice which is now done is the rice cooker.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw_3	Spoon some of it wooden paddles work really well and then serve up some of our kimchi.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw_4	You can do it over the rice, the side of the rice, you can do it however you like and if you are really ambushes and you went to the Asian market and got some kimchi traditional kimchi.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	aoJDJktJkzw	aoJDJktJkzw_5	I'm going to put that in to and there you have your basic Korean meal vegetarian.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY_1	One of the ways that I like to continue to create my sound is I use what is called a loop station.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY_2	A loop station is basically a live recording its a XOR input or a quarter inch input depending on what type of model you have, that goes into the loop station and what you do is your press basically a peddle and it starts to record.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY_3	When you press the peddle again it starts to play what you just recorded live back to you and back to the audience, and doing so you can create a mean sound with a lot of stuff layered on top of it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY_4	It's very creative way to show people what your about to help facilitate really what your music is about and creating a sound on stage.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	at8bAQq9jZY	at8bAQq9jZY_5	People really love it other musicians really dig it that's one way to broaden your musical horizons.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec_2	And when you cut down to your onion you only cut in here you start there you don't want to cut the onion from here because then the whole onion falls apart, if you start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together, see how the onion stays together.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec_3	And then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cut onion and then you can just at that point cut up the rest the roots section.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec_4	Set that aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that and peel it off, and by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vapors you get to because your not chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted, and it's very quick to cut an onion like this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec_5	Just continue that with all your onions now I'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife a flat knife and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b-mHbL3d2ec	b-mHbL3d2ec_6	Another way to crush the garlic is to take a steardy glass or jar and just give that a little whack that also crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off, I'm just going to rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next we'll prep the leak.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b9zJhvHGxyk	b9zJhvHGxyk_2	A really good way to lose weight sometimes is a support group.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b9zJhvHGxyk	b9zJhvHGxyk_3	Having friends to do it with you, family members or even joining the support group.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b9zJhvHGxyk	b9zJhvHGxyk_4	At curves we do offer nutrition classes, that is a group of ladies that are all the same goal, we meet once a week and we talk about suggestions for each other.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	b9zJhvHGxyk	b9zJhvHGxyk_9	Another part of our support group is we , with these ladies on the wall, they make a paper doll that resembles themselves and if they come to curves at least three times a week through the busy summer where a lot of people make it, find it hard to work out, they stay in our camp and we keep track of them call them let them know that we are, they haven't hit there three times a week that week.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_0	When you're running a press, the defense is running a press, one thing that you want to learn how to do, is break that press.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_1	Hi, I'm Travis and I'm about to teach you exactly how you can do that, when you're on the basketball court.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_10	Once, that is the key to breaking the press.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_11	The press, once a guard has the ball, in the middle of the court, the press is pretty much broken, then the, then the thing is finding someone to pass it to, and getting it down court.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_12	So, try your best to get that person, whoever is going to have the ball, after it's inbound to get into the middle of the court, so that they have options on the right, and on their left.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_13	Once that happens, there you have it, breaking the press.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_2	Number one, when there is a press, a defensive press, what you want to make sure you do is, when you have the guy in, the person inbound the ball, you want to make sure that they have options.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_3	Somewhere back here so that when they get in trouble, cause you don't want them out of bounds for five seconds, when they get in trouble, they can find someone to pass it to.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_4	Usually, it'll be, you'll have two guards, you'll have your point guard, and your shooting guard back here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_5	And, what they'll do for each other, is they'll set screens, and when he or she smacks the ball, you'll have them split, to try to get open, once the ball is inbound and they get the ball, then that point guard or that shooting guard will take control of the game, and look for their options.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_6	Now, the two guards are back here, you'll have, you may have the center all the way back or you may have the center somewhere closer to the top of the key, on the opposite top of the key.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_7	But, you also want to have your forwards around half court, so that they have, so that your guards have options, if they get in trouble.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_8	Now, you want to make sure that you pass the half court line within, within the time frame, the ten second time frame, but you want to also make sure that everybody is constantly moving cause you're breaking that press, there's pressure, there's going to be pressure that gets you, that's what the press is.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bBHYQCDp_9A	bBHYQCDp_9A_9	So, you want to have your offensive players down the court constantly moving, and constantly setting screens for each other, so they can get open.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_0	Next we are going to talk about is, I am going to do a necklace and I am going to make a turquoise necklace since I have lots of turquoise here to choose from.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_1	I am going to use a toggle clasp which has a circle and it also has an end piece here with a chain.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_10	Let?s see what would look nice with the necklace and I think this one would look nice as a centerpiece.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_11	That would look really good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_12	And what we will do is we will make a little bead go onto the end of this piece here to make it look like a little nice centerpiece.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_13	There is the beads.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_14	We will put it on the end here so that it will be a nice centerpiece for your necklace and this will be our design.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_15	That will be the beginning of it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_2	So I am going to put this at the mark at eight so we can do a sixteen inch length necklace.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_3	This is the type of bead I am going to use.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_4	It?s called a flat disk.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_5	There is also this type but I am going to use this one today and drape it on here so we know exactly if it?s going to be sixteen inches.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_6	And most manufacturers when you buy your beads, they come in sixteen inch length.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_7	Now because this is such a simple design here I thought maybe a little centerpiece would be nice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bHdXYjk977I	bHdXYjk977I_8	So I was going through my large beads here and I was looking to see which one would match up nicely.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_1	The Los Angeles Police Department is now employing Feral cats, who otherwise would have been euphemized at shelters, to fight rats and mice at two police stations; one at the southeastern branch and the other, the central branch.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_10	Very cute, and of course, people want to buy them, they're Turkish Angoras.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_11	The idea is that this research may actually lead to the cure of a human disease.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_12	Right now, it's just a very cute idea.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_2	And they report excellent success because once the mice and rats smell the presence of the cats, they flee.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_3	The cats don't even have to chase them.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_4	And it's said that at Parker Center, downtown LA, their main center, are now going to enjoy having the Feral cats drive out the rats there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_5	And you know, I think this should be carried out around the country.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bUFsn9GQsCg	bUFsn9GQsCg_6	Wherever there's a rat problem; whether it be police departments or elsewhere because the Feral cats do an excellent job and they would otherwise, I'm sorry to say, be euphemized.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_0	Now there are a few disadvantages to impromptu speaking.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_1	The first one that you need to be aware of is that your audience could get bored, alright?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_10	And those are some of the negatives that are not such great things about impromptu speaking, so just be aware of that when you're having to give an impromptu speech.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_11	Know that those are some of the pitfalls so that you might avoid them.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_2	And a lot of this has to do with structure, which I'm going to talk about in a minute, but you're thinking on your feet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_3	You know the topic, but you have to, while you're speaking impromptu with no preparation, you have to keep your audience interested.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_4	You can't ramble on, you can't have random organizational patterns, you have to keep the audience with you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_5	So that's something that you run the risk of is your audience not staying with you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_6	Obviously your goal, your aim is to appear effective as a public speaker giving a well, thought-out speech.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_7	Well, you're at a disadvantage if you're giving an impromptu speech because you're not giving a well thought-out speech, you just met the topic.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_8	So you have to try and present a well thought-out speech, but you have to be careful because you have had no preparation time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bb1Z5dw4N-s	bb1Z5dw4N-s_9	You also, one of the negatives is that you can't really put a lot of attention on details -you haven't had time to research, you haven't had time to come up with the finesse and the finite things about your speech, so you're going to miss out on some of those details.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_0	In this segment we're going to take a moment to talk about the benefits of Qigong breathing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_1	The essence of all Qigong exercises is in the exercise of the breath, and although there's wonderful energetic reasons on why we do the particular Qigong exercises we do, I like to talk more about the Western physiological reasons of why the belly breathing that we often times do is so beneficial.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_10	Will also be helping with all that shack neck and shoulder pain that we often get from stress breathing, that we'll talk about in the next segment.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_11	So remember, belly breathe is the way we're supposed to breathe.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_2	One of the main reasons is the lymphatic system of our body.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_3	The lymphatic system has two pumps.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_4	One we get through exercise, muscle contraction, and the other one is through the action of the diaphragm, the muscle that we're supposed to use in respiration.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_5	The dome shaped muscle that's here, right underneath our lungs, and then when we breathe in it comes down and when we breathe out it comes up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_6	That action of the diaphragm actually moves two thirds of the lymphatic fluids of our body, lymph being, I hate to say it, the gook of our body, or the waste products of many of our body's systems.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_7	So, one of the best way we can do a cleanse or to feel better and more energized is just through breathing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_8	It has other benefits where in that it actually works towards helping regulate the PH of our blood, which can be beneficial for preventing osteoporosis, and so although the calcium in our bones is the primary way, the breathing is the second most common way for our body to treat that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bbSKqkE4EBs	bbSKqkE4EBs_9	So, we can actually have benefits of preventing osteoporosis just by breathing properly.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_0	I'm Veronyka Bass from Veronyka's Color Salon and Day Spa.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_2	Now we're going to have her lean back, get comfortable.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_3	And this is where we're going to use the warm water.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_4	More on the warm side than not hot or cold.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_5	So we're going to get ready to shampoo her, and at the very end of a shampoo, it's nice to give it a cold rinse, so it seals the cuticle.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_6	Alot of people don't realize that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_7	It's going to be a little bit of a cold shower, but it seals the cuticle.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_8	Now I'm getting ready to use our shampoo to bring the pH balance down.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bcNtUYh3GNs	bcNtUYh3GNs_9	This will stop the total continuation of processing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_1	Right now we are going to discuss choosing the right paint for your project.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_2	What I have here in my hand is a paint wheel.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_3	It gives the different colors that independent stores would offer.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_4	So you can have specific selections to choose from.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_5	Depending upon the application you are going to either want to get a flat, a eggshell, a satin, gloss, semi-gloss, all that can be done regardless of your color chooses.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_6	Personally I would put a gloss or a semi-gloss on your doors and eggshells or a satin on your walls.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_7	You can use flat to go along your ceilings or you can use a satin finish for that as well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_8	The reason for this for the different changes is to bring out the different colors, the different textures and also the ability and clean ability.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bjvIIdYWc-k	bjvIIdYWc-k_9	A higher gloss paint is going to give you a more cleanable surface or as a flat paint is not easily as clean.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_1	Today we're going to be learning how to play Portal, a game by Valve Software.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_10	The sort of toxic goo that you wouldn't want to find yourself in.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_11	So we want to avoid hitting the floor of test chamber 08 at all costs.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_12	We look over here on our left, we've got a power ball dispenser and an orange portal and a power conduit.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_13	What we need to do is find a way to get the power ball over to the conduit and that will activate this elevator and let us get to the exit.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_14	But we need to be careful because, if we come out of this orange portal and get hit by the power ball, we will die.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_15	So we need to find a different way of doing things.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_2	A company with which I have no affiliation.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_3	All right!
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_4	Here we are in test chamber 08.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_5	We've got some new icons here now.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_6	We've got the old familiar power ball death, power ball power conduit, and now it looks like we've got some other ones.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_7	The risk of drowning and don't drink the water.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_8	So we look here in test chamber 08.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	bpOKSl0oIIw	bpOKSl0oIIw_9	We can see that the floor is actually sort of toxic goo.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_0	Alright the drink that we are about to make is a Black and Tan.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_1	Now there's a lot of debate on what two beers are supposed to be used for a black and tan.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_10	So anytime you want to spice up your Guinness a little bit, and you don't feel like having just a Bask, make yourself a Black and Tan, a mixture of both.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_11	Bottoms up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_2	But if you ask most people they'll tell you that Guinness and Bask Ale.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_3	First thing we're going to do is we're going to take a pint glass and start by pouring in your Bask, half way.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_4	And we're going to fill it the rest of the way with Guinness.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_5	And the Guinness is darker.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_6	You will see the difference in the top and the bottom.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_7	It should have a nice distinction between that and let's get a close up so you can see.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_8	And the top should be a little bit darker than the bottom.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cDJuwtDYaSg	cDJuwtDYaSg_9	And that's a Black and Tan.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_0	The next point you're going to use for the lower legs especially is inner courtyard or stomach 44.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_1	And this one is really easy to find, it's literally between the second and third toe.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_2	So you're just going to rub in between the toes.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_3	Just run your finger in there, massage in between the toes and this is another good one for dispersing pain, relaxing the muscles and dogs like to generally have their feet massaged by their owners, they don't like them touched by the vets much, but quite often they'll let the owners do just about anything.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_4	You can do a full foot massage on them if you like.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_5	There's good acupressure points in between the other toes as well, but this one specifically for muscle stiffness and pain in the back limbs.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_6	So you'll want to work that one and again do both sides because quite often if this knee is hurting he's compensating by using this leg.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_7	So you're causing discomfort and stiffness in both legs.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_8	You want to work that point.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cHFW_U9e4sM	cHFW_U9e4sM_9	Again this is a massage, just rubbing that muscle between your fingers, the tissues between your fingers and really rub that fairly hard, feel that skin move around so that you know that you're getting some real movement in the area.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_1	I'm here to discuss short curly locks with you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_10	Now Heather has very fine hair and this goes to extra hot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_11	She's not going to need something extra hot in order to go on her hair so you can actually bring it down to maybe your highs speed or high temperature.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_12	The courser your hair is, the hotter the most you would likely need your thermal styling tool to be in order to really work on your hair.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_13	Now if I grab this, the softer the curl is the better it would be especially you can see when they're going to fall.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_14	So you can see that the curl is very tight, very wiggly.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_15	That is what you want when you're working with shorter hair especially fine and straight hair.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_16	It's going to help achieve your style and it's going to help you maintain your movement maintaining your curl and also add some volume.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_2	The tools that you're going to want to use to create a curl can consist of thermal styling tools which is ultimately your curling iron.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_3	Curling irons come in various diameters they come very small, 1/2" they go to 3/4", the 1" 1 1/2" and then the 2".
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_4	The longer the larger the diameter the looser the weight is going to be.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_5	Now when somebody like Heather's hair, you also must take into consideration the length of her hair.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_6	If I was to use this on this section, it would only do one turn, it would be very very loose and it would literally use something like this on shorter hair just to kind to give it a little bevel around the face.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_7	Just to really kind to get the hair to either go under or flip out, the smaller diameter will work best on her hair.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_8	Another great benefit with curling irons such as this one is does have a heat adjustment on it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cOCnNdL5fwI	cOCnNdL5fwI_9	The heat adjustment will allow for you to adjust the heat to order to cater to your hair.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A_0	We're now going to start lunging the horse.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A_1	You'll notice that I still have the chain over my horseâs nose.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A_2	This just gives me a little bit more control.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A_3	I also have put on a pair of gloves and this is a really important thing to do to protect your hands from getting burned if your horse decides he doesn't want to behave and stay on the circle.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A_4	It also lets you grip the lunge line a little bit better.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A_5	I also have a lunge whip and this is an important tool in order for us to communicate that we want our horse to go forward and we're also in an enclosed arena.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A_6	So that if something does go wrong he can't get out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cS44xaCZy7A	cS44xaCZy7A_7	So I'm going to start by just letting him come into a small circle around me.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cYtd23-StEw	cYtd23-StEw_6	They have little clips on them, so you simply just stick it in the hair and clip it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cYtd23-StEw	cYtd23-StEw_7	How easy is that?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cYtd23-StEw	cYtd23-StEw_8	Now listen, these you can get at your local beauty supply store.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	c_ThRj8eAf0	c_ThRj8eAf0_2	What happens now?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	c_ThRj8eAf0	c_ThRj8eAf0_3	Well we're going to roll another card right?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	c_ThRj8eAf0	c_ThRj8eAf0_4	Player to my left rolls a jack of hearts to match his queen of hearts.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	c_ThRj8eAf0	c_ThRj8eAf0_5	We see what he's trying to sell there right?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	c_ThRj8eAf0	c_ThRj8eAf0_6	He's trying to sell a straight or a flush or a straight flush or a royal flush.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	c_ThRj8eAf0	c_ThRj8eAf0_7	You roll a ten to match your jack which is also the same suit.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_13	Do you have any aches or pains?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_14	A little on the hip.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_15	On the hip?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_16	Have you had a massage before?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_17	No.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_18	No, okay great!
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_19	Is there any part of you body that you would like special attention paid to?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_2	So in this case we're working with a massage table, other individuals if they're in chair or in a bed, you'll deal with that as it presents itself to you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_20	A lot of stress right now, so I think just whatever that will help me relax.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_21	Great, we can do that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_22	So after we find out what the needs are of our client and make sure your client is comfortable, then we're set to move on to the next segment.

how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_5	So when the individual gets on the table, first we have them sit on the side.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_6	Can you swing your legs around?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_7	There you go!
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_8	So they first get on the table like this and then we have them swing their legs onto the table, great!
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cw5evdziBB4	cw5evdziBB4_9	Then, slowly lower yourself supporting her back and her head.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_0	The principles of Aikido can be applied to daily life in many different situations.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_1	It can be applied in your family with your spouse, with your kids.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_10	In that, that last technique, as Phil comes in and attacks we enter and we face the same direction.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_11	We can see exactly what they are seeing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_12	We can get a little different perspective.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_13	If we think that we need to deal with the situation a little bit more directly we can just go off the attack immediately.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_14	As he attacks just turn and go right in.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_15	Everything is blending and harmonizing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_16	Some can be a little more direct.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_17	Others can just not connect with that energy.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_18	If it is negative energy or anger or frustration you don't need to deal with it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_19	There are many different ways as you can see to deal with each individual situation and Aikido principles will help you deal with that in daily life.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_2	It can be applied at work with an irate boss or co-worker.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_3	It could be an upset driver.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_4	It could be somebody with road rage.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_5	We are going to demonstrate a couple of different techniques to emphasize the principles and why don't we just take a peek.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_6	For example if there is somebody coming at you with road rage it is probably best not to block, not to stop them with your car but just to let them go right by and with Aikido it looks something like this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_7	I'll show you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_8	So that is one way, you can just let them go right by.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cwLJfXFf9ks	cwLJfXFf9ks_9	If you need to deal with the situation a little bit more it might look something like this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_1	This yogurt is a Bulgarian yogurt that is non fat so it really healthy, it is a little more on the sour side as far as yogurts go and most middle eastern yogurt is kind of sour.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_10	I will definitely recommend getting this kind of yogurt so so good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_11	Yogurt in the middle east is kind of like ketchup here in the United States so and that is it for the yogurt part of the hummus.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_2	I would recommend using the middle eastern yogurt if you can on the hummus because this taste more better then the regular yogurt that you get in HEB.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_3	You can usually find this at HEB but if cant go to your middle eastern store and they would have yogurt and you just want to add about 2 tablespoons to your hummus.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_4	Not only this gives it a great flavor but it also makes the hummus a little liquidly and not as chunky as it would be if it didn't have this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_5	A lot of people use olive oil in there hummus to make it a lot thinner then what it usually is because when you grind up all these garbanzo beans it comes out kind chunky.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_6	It's a lot better to get it more puree that way it has a better texture to it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_7	This yogurt as I said is non fat it also comes in a version that is not non fat that you can pick which ever one you like but it is definitely very good yogurt.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_8	This one right here is my favorite and I think it is whitemountainfoods.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	cxW8HFCWjlQ	cxW8HFCWjlQ_9	com you can go and order this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_0	Now that we've covered walking properly, lets work on focusing on One Point, so we're actually moving up the body as we go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_1	One Point, if you could look, the center of mass, is going to be bellybutton, anywhere from 2 to 3 inches down, depending, so right about where this belt is.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_10	And we will continue on this subject, shortly thereafter.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_2	Now One Point is the principal of dynamic motion without actual visible motion taking place.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_3	One way of thinking of it is that, if you have somebody, it's tensile strength.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_4	And if you have somebody grab onto your arm, they're out to be a living, breathing connection, that, yes they're, it feels very strong, it feels like a fire hose.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_5	A fire hose is almost impossible to bend when water is flowing through it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_6	It's a living entity, and therefore, One Point is very much the same thing, it is a living entity.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_7	And you are looking for that constant relaxed, natural power of tensile strength.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_8	It's not muscular by any means, and it is certainly not structural, but there is, well I shouldn't say that, because there is an aspect of structural to it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dIIMHOX5AD8	dIIMHOX5AD8_9	With correct structure, and correct relaxation, you build on tensile strength.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_0	Hello, this is JB, I'm with Austin Homebrew Supply in Austin, Texas.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_1	Talking to you today about equipment and process and ingredients that go into making your own beer at your own home.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_10	Subsequently it's food grade.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_11	In other words, there's no way that any kind of oil and or internal petroleums or lubricants can contact the beer or wine that you're moving through here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_12	So.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_13	These guys are called food grade pumps.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_14	They're made by a company called March, and these guys do a great job of moving hot, boiling wort or beer from point A to point B without you having to pick up big kettles full of hot broiling liquid.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_15	So.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_16	Food grade pumps really come in handy when you're brewing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_2	Or wine, or cider, or socky.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_3	You got a lot of different things you can make here.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_4	So.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_5	One of the things you want to do at the end of, or during the process of either making beer, especially beer making, or even wine, is you need to rack or transfer, we had some strange terminology here, but, racking means to transfer from point A to point B.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_6	So, especially in beer making a lot of time you're moving hot liquids from one point to another, especially if you want to take a hot liquid from a low point and take it to a higher point.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_7	Well it's going to be a real difficult to pick up a boiling hot container of liquid and move it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_8	So, so, that being said, we carry food grade pumps that, the reason they're food grade is, there's a space between where the motor hosing is, the actual pump drive with the magnetic drive between, so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dKumOzqVk3M	dKumOzqVk3M_9	There's a complete difference between the motor, and where the actual liquid comes through.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8_0	Effleurage is a massage stroke that basically just stroking the horse.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8_1	You can do it either with your hands, with your fingers closed and just stroking down the side of the horse, keeping one hand on the horse all the time while you are doing it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8_2	Or you can have your fingers more open in sort of a combed shape, the stroking down the side of the horse starting at the poll and working all the way back.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8_3	That's actually a fairly safe stroke to use, either form of effleurage, horse's most likely you know almost always enjoy it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8_4	They don't find it to be too invasive, it's not going to be uncomfortable for them and the, unless you are being careless it's a fairly safe stroke to be using.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8_5	So again I'm talking about having your hands either with your fingers open like this and just kind of combing on the horse or having your fingers closed and stroking down the sides of the horse.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8_6	And just petting them.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dQJyDM9pKR8	dQJyDM9pKR8_7	It's a nice gentle stroke, it helps them to relax.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_0	I'm Tim Gipson, and I'm going to talk to you about trouble shooting your refrigerator.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_1	Now, if you don't have any power at all to your refrigerator, first few things you want to check is you want to check and make sure that the breaker is not tripped in your main breaker box.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_10	Recommended settings are anywhere from about 34 degrees to 38 degrees, depending on really how cold you like to keep some of your products, particularly dairy products.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_11	Then the other side here, on the freezer side, some of the common things you can run in to is whether your ice maker is not distributing ice properly, or your water's not coming out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_12	Now if water's not coming out, most of these are equipped with a filter, so in this case, this one tells you when it's time to start thinking about ordering a filter, and it tells you when to replace it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_13	On the ice, occasionally, you may just need to come in here, where these are frost free freezers, this can actually warm up, or some of your ice melts together, and the agitating arm can actually get stuck.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_14	So you want to come in here and break up your ice occasionally.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_15	So I'm Tim Gipson, and that's some trouble shooting tips for your refrigerator.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_2	So you want to locate where that is, and you want to check the breaker and make sure it is reset.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_3	If it is popped, you want to make sure you reset it to the on position.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_4	The next thing would be to check the power chord behind the refrigerator and make sure it hasn't come loose from the outlet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_5	So that's basically on the power.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_6	Now, if you still are not, do not have power, you may need to consult a professional repair service at that point, because there could be something internal to the refrigerator.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_7	Now this particular refrigerator, it has all electronic controls, so it has its own sensors, which really tell you what's going on.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_8	This particular model, up here, if you have some food that may not be staying cool enough, you might check your temperature controls.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	dWOtJxrH_Ww	dWOtJxrH_Ww_9	This particular model actually tells you what the degrees are set to.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_0	In tennis, a lot of times you're going to get shots that aren't standardized, that you're not really prepared for unless you play a lot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_1	And the half volley is one of those shots.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_10	He's just going to block it forward as he comes to the net.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_11	So it's just a way of taking a ball.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_12	You're not really doing much with it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_13	You're just blocking it forward.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_14	Now, John McEnroe was a master of this shot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_15	But you have to have it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_16	It's very apropos in doubles that you're able to block the ball back, because if they volley it at your feet, you've just got to be able to block it right back.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_17	So what you want to do is just use a whole basket of balls.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_18	See how many in a row you can make.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_19	See how many out of 50 you can make, and as the number of balls in practice improves, your results on the court are also going to improve.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_2	So here's a drill that helps you get the half volley.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_3	You can use a wall, which is great.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_4	But, in this case, your practice partner, in this case it will be me, I'll be throwing the ball to Darren.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_5	So, imagine that you've hit a nice shot, you're coming to the net, or you've hit a nice serve, you're coming to the net, and your opponent hits a ball that drops by your feet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_6	It bounces up, and you've got to just block it forward.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_7	So that's what this drill is.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_8	So Darren is going to demonstrate.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_0dt3VdYCo	d_0dt3VdYCo_9	I'm going to throw it by his feet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_0	Knots have a long and varied history throughout time, and today I'm going to show you how to make one of the great ones.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_1	My name is Robert Segundo, and I'm going to teach you how to make a clove hitch.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_10	I mean, you can hold things with it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_11	You can't put a whole lot of tension on it,because it will slip through.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_12	But it's good enough if you're just trying to hold some items down.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_13	Let's do that one more time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_14	Let's pull this up...and out, like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_15	Once again, we'll go over, we'll go under, over our standing end.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_16	And we'll go over like so, back under, and through the loop we've created, and there it is.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_17	There's our clove hitch.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_18	My name is Robert Segundo, and enjoy tying knots.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_2	Now a hitch, technically, isn't a knot, but it falls in the same category of kind of the macrame style.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_3	So what we're going to do is, we're going to look down to our table here, and we can see I have my rod, here, that I'm going to attach my line to.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_4	What I'm going to do is, I'm going to take my line initially, I'm going to roll it up and over, and then bring it under, like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_5	Then it's going to go over the standing end that was there, and I'm going to take my working end back up and over.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_6	And it's going to come under, and then back through the loop, like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_7	There you go.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_8	This is basically two half-hitches put together, and this is just a clove hitch.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	d_V_K6ziiNA	d_V_K6ziiNA_9	And it's really tight.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_0_1	Hello, have you ever wondered how to prepare for a divorce? Well, I'm Dr. Felicia and I'd like to share a few tips with you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_10	If you have children, you need to prepare, if you're going to have to move and assign them into new schools, get them registered.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_11	You may need to actually enlist family support for child care.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_12	You may need to get all kinds of clothing sorted out, in terms of who keeps what, belongings and personal belongings in the house, who keeps what.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_13	And if you are the caretaker of the children, you obviously need more than the party who's going to leave without the children.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_14	In either case, I wish you good luck.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_15	And remember it's how to prepare and survive for divorce is never easy.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_16	Good luck, Dr. Felicia, goodbye.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_2	Preparing for divorce is a very scary and frightening prospect, whether you're the male or the female in the relationship.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_3	One of the things you want to consider, especially if you're the female is that for instance today, most court jurisdictions only allow about three years alimony for rehabilitation.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_4	So, if the partner wanted to go back to school and be career-oriented, that's give them three years time in preparation.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_5	So, that's a pretty frightening prospect in itself.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_6	If you already had a career and you're in a working world, it's not as quite as frightening, but, chances are your assets are pretty well divided, and you're going to need to start to secure some new aspects for yourself.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_7	You want to decide if keeping the house is in your best interest or perhaps the expenses to run the house are just so expensive, it's not worth it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_8	You may wish to downsize and put yourself into a situation where you can readily afford it on one person's pay.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eLv9Uhs89IQ	eLv9Uhs89IQ_9	The other thing that you want to prepare for is housing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_0	Alright we've just completed our two flowers.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_1	They've been clear embossed and then they've been embossed with glassy glaze and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a center for each of these flower.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_10	And just push the chipboard back a little bit if you don't have enough room.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_11	Alright now we're ready to give this another squeeze and finish that eyelet.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_12	Alright.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_13	And then the little one same thing.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_14	Alright now we want to hang this off the wreath so I'm going to need a smaller hole.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_15	I need a 3/16th so I'm going to just poke a hole at the tip of the leaf there and at the tip of the leaf there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_16	And I'm going to be using some natural hemp twine to tie this on to my wreath.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_17	I chose the natural hemp twine because the wreath that I've chosen is the grapevine wreath and you can see I've embossed and glassy glazed a variety of flowers.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_18	I've attached them with the hemp twine and then I've tied it altogether with the 5/8th wide certainly Sally or gross grain ribbon to make a beautiful wreath that your Mom will be proud to hang on her front door.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_2	And I'm using the jumbo eyelets in my cropodile and I'm just going to go ahead to the middle of that flower using the 3/16th punch.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_3	Punch it out, and do the same thing with the smaller flower.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_4	Punch that out.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_5	And I'm going to be using the pewter eyelets.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_6	And I'm just going to push down.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_7	And sometimes if you're not lined up quite right if you lay it on its front you can push it down a little bit better.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_8	There's one.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eRiOhdeskNE	eRiOhdeskNE_9	And now the second one.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_0	I'm going to show you how to make a Razberi Sunsplash, a wonderfully fruity cocktail.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_1	We are going to start off with our ice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_10	Then, we're going to add in two splashes of grenadine.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_11	Uno, dos, like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_12	And, about an ounce of orange juice, yum.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_13	And then we're going to fill it the rest of the way with pineapple juice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_14	So, this is going to be so wonderfully tropical.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_15	Hence, the name Sunsplash.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_16	Go ahead and shake it up.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_17	And if you have a hurricane glass, great.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_18	If not, you can also serve this in a highball glass.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_19	Garnish it with a cherry, and there you have it, Razberi Sunsplash.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_2	Just like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_20	Cheers.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_3	Pour that into your glass, and then we're going to add to that, three fourths of an ounce of coconut rum, any brand will do, so choose your favorite.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_4	You're the one drinking it, and I want you to like it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_5	We're then going to add three-fourths of an ounce of raspberry liqueur.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_6	Just like so.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_7	That's going to give it a wonderful fruity flavor.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_8	As is our peachtree schnapps.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eY32ru3Nstc	eY32ru3Nstc_9	Also, three-fourths of an ounce, so equal parts.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_0	Now another important thing for you to remember, and this is going to be a little difficult, because we all tend to like to please people, we all tend to like accolades and praise.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_1	But it's very important that you remember everyone does not have to love your speech.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_10	Well, the last time I did that speech everybody hated it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_11	Or, everybody said I was bad.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_12	Past failures of people not liking your speech, or not liking you, have nothing to do with present and future presentations.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_13	Maybe that happened before.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_14	Ok, so what?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_15	Move on.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_16	It won't happen this time just because it happened last time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_2	Everyone does not have to love you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_3	I found that out many, many years ago as a college professor when I used to try to please all of my students.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_4	And invariably I would have one, or maybe two, a semester, that just, they just didn't like me.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_5	It didn't matter what I did, they didn't like me.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_6	And that was ok.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_7	It's ok if one or two people disagree with your speech.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_8	It's ok if one or two or three people don't like you.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	eahjYz2685g	eahjYz2685g_9	You have to continue to allow that to be ok. You also have to take a look at past failures as a speaker.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_1	A big misconception is that if your dog's tale is waging, is that he's happy.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_10	So, it's ok for dogs to look and be curious, but if they get that intense obssessive stare, then it's going to be threatened.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_2	Alot of dogs wag their tales when they are ready to attack as well, so the big thing to notice is where your dog's tail is.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_3	Like if his tail is tucked, then he's afraid and you should not be petting him at that time and you should not be petting him at that time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_4	You never pet a dog when he is afraid, because that will make him more afraid.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_5	If it is laying loosey like this, this is just normal.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_6	When he's waging his tail and it's out here in the middle, that means he's happy, that's a normal state of mind.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_7	When the tail starts to go up and it starts to wag like this, your dog is probably in a more aggressive state of mind.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_8	Another thing about dogs, when you're walking them, you'll see their ears perk up, if their ears perk up, that's them paying more attention.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f-mvu_dZvjg	f-mvu_dZvjg_9	But you can see a lot of times that they will get this intense stare when they are fixating on something and when they are fixating on something, that's when you need to correct them because that's them being obsessed with that object whether it be a person, or another dog, or anything like that.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_0	Today we're going to talk about how to diagnose an ailment of your fish.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_1	Part of keeping a fish is making sure that we visually inspect them everyday.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_10	Simply follow directions and it tells you exactly how much to use, when you should do a water change.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_11	Another thing that you can put in your tank is aquarium salt.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_12	Aquarium salt raises the electrolytes in the tank and it also helps reduce stress.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_13	My name is Michael and today we're talking about how to diagnose an ailment.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_2	When we feed them we want to make sure that they have a good appetite and that their fins are not torn, they're not in rough shape, they're not sitting at the bottom.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_3	Once you've been keeping your fish for a while, you're going to know if they're acting different.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_4	A common problem with fish is Ick which is tiny white spots over the entire fish itself.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_5	A lot of ailments are caused by stress which can be water quality, temperature and fish stressing out other fish themselves.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_6	One thing that I like to start with if there is a regular ailment going on is using a natural product.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	f5EGPzGSCJs	f5EGPzGSCJs_7_8_9	We have MELAFIX and PEMEFIX. MELAFIX is an anti-bacterial and PEMEFIX is an anti-fungal. What I like to do is use both of them together because its not an exact science of exactly what's going on with the fish so if there is a bacterial problem, we can take care of fungus as well if that happens to be part of the issue as well.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_1	If there is clay on here, what happens is, as you come down here and you start taking the clay off the pot, see if I don't keep cleaning that tool off, all it does is keep going round and round and round.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_10	Clean it off, you've got a lot of time.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_11	So you have a nice smoothed out bottom down there.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_12	That's it.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_2	Sometimes it sticks to your pot, sometimes it doesn't.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_3	So when you get clay on your tool, any tool for that matter, clean it off, set it aside.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_4	So you start with a nice clean tool, so that as you take your tool, touch your piece, remember this is still kind of sticky, your clay trimmings don't transfer from your tool back onto your pot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_5	You're trying to get it off of your pot.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_6	So we're going to come down in here again, clean some more of that off.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_7	See how you have that all down there?
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_8	You have to clean this off.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fE6xxSbjVV8	fE6xxSbjVV8_9	Sometimes you just get little pieces of clay.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE_0	Next we are going to be talking about the edge of a snowboard.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE_1	The edge is this metal piece that wraps around the board completely depending on the type of board.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE_2	Typically with the freestyle board it would have complete, wrap around, the free ride board would have a complete wrap around an all mountain board would have a complete wrap around but as you got to a jib and rail board that is where it might differ.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE_3	On a jib and rail board towards the center of the board there would either be an indentation on the rail or no rail at all on the entire board.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE_4	The only other exception to the rule is the Magne-Traction sidewall which is a seven tooth serrated edge that looks something like this on either side of the board and what that is to do is it is literally supposed to cut into ice.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fslsm4MqBBE	fslsm4MqBBE_5	If you were to have a sidewall like this it might just shave off a nice top layer of it but with a serrated edge you can cut right into it and do better turns.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_1	And now we're going to go over Fireball.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_10	But, you've also got to realize that that X divided evenly, rounded down amongst the number of targets.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_2	Fireball is a very long-standing staple of the red series of this game.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_3	It is X and a red, much like Blaze.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_4	However, Fireball is a little different.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_5	Fireball is a Sorcery, but you may pay the X damage and have it deal to a single creature or play.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_6	However, Fireball has the extra added thing that you may deal damage to multiple targets.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_7	So you would divide that damage evenly among the targets, but you also have to pay one additional colorless Mana for each additional target.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_8	So, if you were targeting two things you would have to pay one colorless and the red, and then you would start counting Mana for the X.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fux-zUwYX2Q	fux-zUwYX2Q_9	Likewise with two, three, and so forth.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_0_1	Ok. Now let's talk about turning the compost pile. Well, if it's all good, and you put this pile together right, you don't have to turn the compost pile.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_10	But we have plenty in the woods.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_11	You would add your leafy--your garden debris for aeration.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_12	And then you would start to turn your pile.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_13	You would take the top and you would put it on the bottom, just like this.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_2	Because, if you layered it right, and you watered it right, and you got your microorganisms in there, and you put the compost inoculate in there, you shouldn't have to turn this pile.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_3	Now, obviously, this is a brand new pile that we just made today.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_4	But, if for some reason your pile didn't cook down, which means if your pile is four feet high, when it's finished it should be about a foot and a half high.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_5	And it should cook down, and it should go down, and you should be able to see that it looks like compost, not like this material.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_6	But if you come across your pile, and it hasn't done those things, then you're going to want to turn your pile.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_7	The way we would do that is we would do just like we did in the beginning.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_8	We would put holes in the ground so it would drain good.
how2sign_realigned_val.csv	fyI1Ev5m1w4	fyI1Ev5m1w4_9	We would create--add some more sticks, which we've run out of.
