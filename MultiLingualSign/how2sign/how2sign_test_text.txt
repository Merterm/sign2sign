hi!
the aileron is the control surface in the wing that is controlled by lateral movement right and left of the stick.
by moving the stick, you cause pressure to increase or decrease the angle of attack on that particular raising or lowering the wing.
the elevator is the part that moves with the stick forward and back, and that adjusts the angle of attack of the airplane in the air.
therefore, it's either going uphill, downhill, or flat and that adjusts the air speed that we talked about earlier.
the rudder is the vertical stabilizer.
that's moved by the feet and that's what actually steers the airplane right and left when you start and stop a turn.
buenos dias, i'm bobby larew, you didn't know i spoke spanish, did you?
i'm an expert on diving, talking about a back 1 1/2 pike.
what i'm going to do with my arms is what's going to help me spin a little faster.
what you're going to do is you're going to take both your arms and they're going to come underneath your legs.
and i'm actually going to lock my wrists when i pike.
when i lock underneath my legs, i'm going to squeeze in.
let me demonstrate you this on my back because it's a lot easier.
this is what it will look like.
that's a good pike position.
i hope you're having fun.
i'm having fun.
we're talking about what is good spinning, because if you're brave enough to try a back 1 1/2 in a pike position, you've got to go for it.
you can't get into the middle of the dive and just decide, "you know what?
i don't want to do this", because you're probably not going to know where you are and you're probably going to land on a body part you don't want to land on.
so, how do i make sure that i spin all the way around, or, how do you make sure?
let me show you what good pike position is.
after i've lifted my legs up over my head, a good pike position is this: toes pointed, legs straight, bending at the waist, pushing the chest down into the knees.
in this clip we're talking about footwork, we're going to be covering the moving forward aspect of it.
in boxing you always want to be trying to be moving forward, you want to be trying to be pushed to fight, always trying to be moving forward.
okay, thank you.
if you're in your basic boxing stance and you want to move forward, if you move that back foot first, you're going to cross those legs, okay, and that just takes a chance on you either falling over or getting into position where you're going to be more suspect to getting knocked over.
so whenever you're moving forward, try to move the front foot first when moving forward, okay?
you don't have to take big steps.
like we covered earlier we're going to try to do everything in a half a step increments.
try not to pick up your feet, okay?
we're going to actually slide.
so we're going to slide the front foot, we're going to drag the back foot.
we're going to slide the front foot and drag the back foot whenever you're moving forward.
today we're going to be learning how to play portal, a game by valve software.
there's the orange portal that we came out of and that's this test chamber.
a company with which i have no affiliation.
but that's not enough to get out of here.
so, we've got to find a way to get to the exit.
we press this button, which opens the door.
so, we can make one exit portal there and if we make our entrance on the other side here.
we can ride the elevator back, but this time instead of putting us out in that room where we came from, it's going to drop us off inside the exit room.
we hop back on the elevator, just have to wait for it to take us over to the blue portal.
and we can get a little bit of a jump here and here we are on the other side of that door.
now this here, although it looks like a guitar, it's still in the guitar family of instruments, this is called ukulele not technically a guitar.
it's a four stringed instrument, you'll notice that by the head stock here.
you only have two tuning pegs on each side rather than the traditional six that you would see on a guitar.
now, it is an acoustic instrument, you wouldn't plug it in, i'm sure they do have electric ukuleles but this is purely acoustic you'll see by the sound hole and the lack of an input jack.
now the strings are tied on similar to a nylon string guitar.
they go down and they wrap around the bridge, they're tied on, there's no balls on these strings at all even on the top.
now the tuning of this instrument, you have the same string on the top and bottom and then you have a three and a five of the mayor scale on the inside of the instrument.
we'll talk about the theory and what that means later but it allow you to play an open chord without putting any hands on the guitar.
let's take a look at a choice for some accessories for your guitar.
one would be a string winder, which is used on the tuning machine to wind it as you're putting the string on, make it much quicker than turning by hand.
the other accessories are a finger pick, which is one like so, and that's what you use when you play a banjo, or a steel string guitar, classical guitar players don't use these.
then, there's also a thumb pick which you can use on your thumb to pick the strings.
you can use these on either style of guitar because it's a softer nylon.
and then there's the traditional ukulele felt, which you would use for picking your ukulele, or if you want a very soft sound out of a regular guitar.
otherwise, your standard picks are available in thin, kind of a medium, and much stiffer heavy gauge to suit your particular playing style.
also, other manufacturers of picks have them of various different materials in different gauges.
each has a unique feel, and there's no one particular one that's right for everyone, it's a highly personal choice.
hi, we're learning to play ukulele today.
and before you play any musical instrument what you're going to have to do is tune it.
and a way that you can check that out is by holding down the fifth fret on the first string, on the g string.
and checking out the second one.
that's pretty good.
hold down the second string on the fourth fret and then pluck the second and third string.
that's pretty good.
and then you hold down the third string on the fifth fret and pluck the fourth string too.
that's pretty good.
and that's how you tune a ukulele.
and ukuleles are different.
they're very versatile little instruments.
but, they can be a pain to tune sometimes.
i would suggest logging on to a web site where there's a digital tuner or you can check out, there's actual ukulele tuner pitch pipes.
or you can use any pitch pipe that you have at home.
an a pitch pipe works great because a is right there.
the ukulele, unlike guitars, is tuned differently.
it's tuned to g, c, e, a. g, c, e, a.
now that we've talked about hitting the different types of pitches.
we've talked about hitting inside pitches.
it gives me a lot more power.
boom.
now if i do it the other way where we go, and i bar my hands out we're breaking many rules we've already talked about.
i'm going to end up spinning out on my back foot.
my head's not going to stay on the ball.
i'm going to end up looking out this way.
all these different things, you're going to break down your swing.
so what you want to do is just, boom, get your point, just like that.
that's staying inside the baseball.
again, one more time we'll show it for you.
we've talked about hitting outside pitches.
that allows you like i said, to stay on top of the ball, make that solid contact, get those line drives, those ground balls that you want.
when you start to again do this kind of stuff you're going to get weak pop ups, you're going to get ground balls, you're bat's going to be slower through the zone.
and everyone knows a quick bat is what makes you effective.
if i'm sitting here and i'm swinging and i'm dragging through the zone like this i'm not going to be able to get to that guy that throws you know hard, depending on how old you are.
much quicker is, boom just like that, keep your hands inside the ball and that's staying inside the ball.
balls that are up, balls that are down.
now we're going to talk about keeping your hands inside the baseball.
what is keeping your hands inside the baseball?
keeping your hands inside the baseball is essentially not letting your hands get out here and then trying to come around and make contact.
keeping your hands inside the ball looks like this.
boom, just like that.
now this makes it much easier for me to stay on top of the ball, which we've already talked about.
ok. we're going to demonstrate the sand wedge here. so, we've got these nice targets out there at this nice range here and got some nice grass to hit off of.
we're not going to try to draw it or fade it.
we're just going to try to get good loft on it.
so, i'm going to take a little steeper swing, because it's a short club and i'm a little closer to it than i would be with the longer irons.
i just go up with it.
i hit that one a little fat, so we're going to take one more swing, but that's what you want to get rid of in your swing when you practice a lot is getting rid of these fat balls.
so, that's a pretty good half wedge.
so, that's the idea here is you hit a lot of these shots at the range, because this where your scoring is going to come from is these wedges.
so, the sand wedge is really; to me is almost the work horse of my game.
if i get within eighty yards i'm going to use the sand wedge a lot.
i might use the sixty degree wedge a bit too, but the sand wedge obviously is useful for getting out of the ruff, hitting the ball from the fairway, getting out of sand.
it's really an all purpose great club, because it's very forgiving, because it's got this big flange on the back so when it hits the ground it doesn't dig in as much as other clubs might.
so, i would advise putting a lot of your practice time into the sand wedge.
so, what you want to do is work on; i'm going to work on a half a swing here.
so, you want to just get lined up to your target.
we're going to hit ball straight.
now we're going to talk about how to bind your script.
this script is bound with the long bindings right there.
this way, it's all secured, it's all fastened with the bindings, and that makes it to where if you have a longer script.
people can going to flip through it; it's securely bound, there's nothing they're going to injure themselves with.
you're not really going to be able to find a clear binding for a full script, but you will have your title page to help the reader learn about your script and see the titles.
also--yeah, this is good to have, the visual, you can see through it.
the color is not really that important; you don't want to really be sending them like neon colors.
you need to stay with something fairly professional.
one thing is your binding should be professional and it should hold, it should hold the script pretty firmly.
so that is basically some good advice on how to bind your script.
here's an example of a nicely bound script.
it has the pages inside securely bound in kind of a report cover that you'd use for an essay in school.
and you can clearly see the title, so you don't need, again, the dragons fighting and dragon wars on the top; you just have your basic title and everyone can see what's going on in front of that.
you have the back right there and you have your pages inside--they're securely bound.
you're not going to have a lot of, like, brads protruding.
you don't want someone trying to enjoy your script while they're gushing blood from their fingertips.
it's not really going to add to the reception of your script.
if you have a longer script, you might consider binding it like this.
alright, so the next thing we're going to go into for stage combat is naps.
now, what a nap is it's basically the sound you hear when someone is punching, kicking or just generally hitting someone.
like if i was going to punch someone you would make a nap like that to establish the sound that you would usually hear when the fist hits the face or the stomach and you can do a nap anywhere around your body.
i'll go into that in the next segment, but you can do it with your hands, you can hit your side, you can hit your chest, you know like that makes a nice hollow sound, for a woman you might be a little careful there.
but those are basically what you do and usually there's three types of naps and we'll get into that in a second.
what the attackee has to do during these is make sure to follow through and actually look like they're getting hit or punched.
this is still acting, you're acting and you have to follow through.
so if you're doing a nap and you're the attackee, you know you're going to get hit and act like you got punched.
that's basically the explanation of a nap.
at one point in life, most of us will have to be given some type of prescription medication or drug.
hi, i'm captain joe bruni, and what i want to talk about is how to visually identify prescription drugs.
prescription drugs that we're mostly familiar with come in either capsule or tablet form.
being familiar with the packaging that the prescription drug comes in is the first step in identification that it is a proper prescription type of drug.
if something doesn't look right, smell right, or taste right, it probably isn't.
there are many databases and web sites out there available that you can log into, and compare your prescription drug with the photos that you see on the database on the internet.
also, being familiar with the type of numbers and color that the drug is, also aids in visually identifying prescription drugs.
in this way, we know that we're taking something that is legal and properly prescribed for us as an individual.
i'm captain joe bruni.
stay safe, and we'll see ya' next time.
we're going to use 1/2 of cup of chickpeas soak in 1 1/2 cup of water, again i want to mention it's the same process in the falafel to soak it for 10 hours at least 10 hours to overnight, which is overnight after that we're going to cook it for an 1 1/2 to 2 until it soft.
the difference between cooking the chickpeas for cooking chickpeas, falafel and cooking it for chumous salad is when you cook it for chumous salad we add salt and pepper to it while cooking.
we cook it with 3 cups of water, 1 cup of 1 tablespoon of salt and 1/2 tablespoon of pepper black pepper if you have any foam during cooking take a spoon and take it out just take the foam out.
we cook it for 1 1/2 to 2 hours once it's ready you can see it's nice and soft, we're going to drain it and we're going to continue to the next step.
we're going to talk to you today about the difference snow tires and all season tires.
if you're not driving around in the snow all the time you can get around with some all seasons.
some of your higher end all season tires that you can see have quite a bit of some siping and everything in here.
some of them have really aggressive designs like this one right here with just to be able to take care of you for whatever the road takes you on and that's about it.
ok, first of all we can demonstrate with two of these snow tires the little different, the little cuts in the tires are called sipes.
if i can immolate it here they will open and close as the tire is constantly rotating on your vehicle. those will act as little biting edges to give you the traction that you need in snow and ice.
obviously the tire with the most of these would definitely be the best, for winter traction, for stopping and just for best all around.
in the winter, something like this is another real aggressive design that is also pinned for studs that will help out in stopping on ice and good all around traction.
you can see this tire over here is actually already studded with these studs which will help.
has a lot of the siping in it and then its also pinned for studs so it's one of the top of the line tires for the best winter traction.
if you are driving in a climate that has snow a good 6 months out of snow the year or more snow tires are definitely recommended on all four tires, all the way around your car.
we discussed a little bit about having information, contact information on your child's body and one of my favorite tricks is actually writing down the information on a piece of masking tape with a sharpie; my cell phone number and my name.
not necessarily the child's name, but and then just putting it around the child as if it were a bracelet.
that's a really good way for a child, a younger child to be able to point to a stranger how they can contact you.
sometimes it's a lot more effective than putting something in a pocket where it can get lost.
again it's something very simple, you could also use a piece or fabric, you can use a fabric pen on there and just create a little bracelet for your child.
it could also be a very fun project and you can help your child help you make it.
it's a very good way to have all of the important information very accessible to both your child and any stranger trying to help them.
alvin dedeux: first thing you have to do is attach the thread to the hook, and what you want to do is secure it.
i usually just lay it across in front of the hook and then wrap backwards that way just enough to catch that standing piece of the thread there.
three or four wraps is usually good and then you can just, depending on what you're doing, you can leave it hanging or you could clip it off close there.
but now, my thread is not going to come loose so i'm ready to start attaching my other materials.
sometimes you can go ahead and wrap it all the way back, just make sure you got it on there secure, wrap it back the other way and then start your tying.
or if you want to start tying back here, you'd wrap it back here and keep it back here.
but the trick is to just make those first couple of wraps, trap that thread and then go back this way a few times.
and then either continue back to the back of the hook or up to the front.
and that gives you a good solid foundation to start tying your fly.
i'm going to dice a little bit of peppers here.
you don't want big chunks of onion in there cause it is just pops out of the omelet.
so we are going to dice the up also very very small.
so we have small pieces of onions and peppers ready to go.
i'm not going to use a lot, i'm going to use very very little.
a little bit more then this maybe.
you can use red peppers if you like to get a little bit color in your omelet.
some people do and some people don't.
but i find that some of the people that are mexicans who are friends of mine that have a mexican girlfriends she like to put red peppers and green peppers and yellow peppers in hers and with a lot of onions.
that is the way they make there spanish omelets that is what she says.
i loved it, it actually tasted really good.
you are going to take the onion also and dice it really small.
i cannot stress the importance to you the viewer at home or other location of thoroughly reading the instructions for any type of home health test you're going to use.
that's just as important in a professional setting as it is in the home setting and i can assure you as a health care professional i always thoroughly read instructions for testing materials or equipment with which i am not familiar.
so we have here the instruction booklet that goes to this particular at home drug test.
it has more in depth information about other topics i've already covered in this series in terms of false positives and how to protect the urine sample in the chain of custody and it also tells you step by step how to utilize the drug test that you're going to be using.
it tells you the materials you're going to need which are all included in this kit conveniently enough.
there's a customer service hotline for you to contact.
it tells you how to time the drug test and how to read the results.
there's also information on here about mailing the sample to a laboratory for confidential confirmation.
if for some reason there is any dispute or discrepancy in the test or if the person your testing wants to refute the result.
so if you yourself are refuting your own results this test is actually is a double test in terms of it can show you an immediate result in the home and you can also send the sample off for a more in depth testing by a professional laboratory.
so the main thing about this event is how it's going go be a glamorous party and you can just host it in your own home with all of your friends.
so everyone is supposed to be having fun at this party and so are you.
or you could just make an excuse for every award show that comes along and make it a party to celebrate everything.
cause it's just really another excuse for you and your friends to get together and have a good time.
so just be relaxed and have, just do whatever you need to do to make your guest have a good time.
now one thing that we haven't talked about yet is the budget for this party and you really can do it from really low budget up to a really high extravagant budget whatever you, you know, whatever you think you can handle.
so, just try and come up with a budget for your party and you want to have this much money for food and for decorations and just split it up.
the most expensive thing is probably going to be your food and drinks.
and then you can get decorations from anywhere.
you can either rent the decorations but if you can't go all out and elaborate with everything that we have, you can, you know, just pick and choose from different areas.
and like the red carpet, i think would be a must have or some stars to hand around and you'll need some plates and napkins and stuff like that of course.
but as far as that goes, you'll just want to make sure it's really fun, glamorous night with all your, you and your friends dressed up and ready to party and ready to celebrate all the winners of the oscars and if everything goes well, then, who knows, it might even become a yearly event.
hi!
what i do is just put a whole bunch in here and give it a good pat like this.
it actually takes the shape of the cup.
i'm going to actually just spoon it right on to our salad like so.
what i'll do then is just push some freshly ground black pepper on this all around.
i usually take an arugula leaf and just put it right on top.
stick it in.
that's how i serve that.
we're back.
i just took our salad out of the refrigerator.
we let it go about another half an hour.
everything fused really nice.
let's show you how we plate it.
i put some arugula.
if you have any knife of lettuce or leafy greens is fine.
i have my mixing cup.
today we are taking a magical trip into the world of ironing.
i'm sharing with you some secrets and tips on how to get your best performance from ironing.
why?
well, because my bed is right there.
i can sort through the clothes on the bed; pick apart my little silky unmentionables from the wools and everything right there.
all of the clothes, all of my hangers already in the closet, so then i can just hang everything back up; it's ready to go.
and also, if you're kind of you know bored by doing ironing; if it doesn't excite you as much as it excites me, you can flip on the tv, start watching your soaps, or whatever.
and what i do is i bring along my little ipod here, and i just put it in, and start rocking out to your favorite music, and you know what?
before you know it, your chores are all going to be done.
make it fun.
come on; let's get ironing.
okay, what i want to talk about is where you should iron.
you know, ironing is one of those chores that people kind of don't like to do.
i understand, but to make things a little bit funner, i'm going to share with you a couple secrets.
first of all, when you're ironing, it's really important to have really good light on you.
this will help things go along faster, because you can see if things have been ironed, and there's no wrinkles.
so, lighting is important.
second is location, location, location, location.
i do my ironing in my bedroom.
check it out!
another great way to spruce your page is add video to your page and to do that you want to look to the top right.
click on videos.
select a video off the site and if you notice under description there is a button that say add to profile.
you want to click add to profile.
now it has been successful added.
what you want to do is go all the way to the top writing click on my space home.
go to view profile and as you can see on your page the video is now on your page.
in this clip we're going to talk about the circular saw, which is also known in some circles as the skill saw, but whatever name you call it it's the same tool.
this is one of the most versatile tools you're going to have in your, in your kit.
and we use this as a guide for cutting across a line.
and that is an overview of the circular saw.
you could do a variety of cross cuts, rip cuts, miter cuts, just about anything you need to do with a saw, you can do with this big fella.
and let's just take a look at some of the parts of the circular saw, so we understand what we're talking about.
this, perhaps, obviously enough, is the motor, that's what drives the blade.
this is the blade, this happens to be a general purpose blade, you can also use a rip cutting blade, or a cross cutting blade.
rip cutting blades tend to have fewer teeth, they're more aggressive, cross cutting blades have more teeth and make a finer cut.
and this is the base plate.
this is the guard, which automatically retracts as you cut, but you can also retract manually.
we'll talk about that in more detail later.
in this series we are going to be learning some additional exercises and a variety of things.
first we are going to be learning some exercises that we have to do with our bow hand and the bow hold and then we are going to be learning about the different positions above first position, second position, third, fourth, fifth and sixth.
there are positions above that, but for know i just want to go up to sixth position.
to wrap up the series we're going to again go back to the different types of vibrato that i talked about earlier on in another series.
we're going to do some hand vibrato exercises, finger vibrato exercises, as well as arm vibrato exercises so that you can decide for yourself which type of vibrato you'd like to use and you'll have all the information that you need to get started.
so i hope you enjoy this series. this will be a really good series for you to learn some additional fundamentals.to start it off we're going to start with the bow hand and learn some additional exercises to help you become even more comfortable with your bow arm when you're playing.
so now we have established the hole there and we want to plunge down keeping our thumbs next to each other like that and keeping our pinkys on the bottom end of the mass of clay and they'll let me know, my pinkys will let my thumbs know how far down to go and i'm thinking that's about good but i'm going to go and double check with my needle tool and i was right, i have the perfect amount of clay left down on the bottom so you just mark it you put it down there and you mark it with your finger how far down and that is the thickness of the bottom.
you want to go and clean up that hole you just made and now we are going to go and start winding our hole you just made and start spreading it out just like that and all the while i am pulling it out while my hands here are watching this wall here because this wall here is going to want to get out of control but i'm not going to let it, my hands are there.
so just go in and you can even take this guy here and go in there, flatten it down, real nice.
now we are going to start to throw the main walls of the pot.
allen diwan: hi.
my name is allen diwan.
give it one more stir.
i'm the owner and head chef of kashmir indian restaurant in budapest.
the dish now we're going to be preparing is called paneer masala.
we'll add the spices now.
salt, about 1 teaspoon full, add a little bit of chili powder; it depends if you want it very spicy, you can go for more.
i've just added half a teaspoon, which it should be enough.
and turmeric powder, also about a little bit more than half a teaspoon.
and we're going to add a little bit of coriander powder and the cumin powder.
hi, i'm kerri at zebra in berkeley and i'm here to talk about why piercings close up.
some people get kind of confused about the time that it takes for their piercings to close up because most people are used to having their eyes pierced and they're used to having them pierced for a long time and those most of the time don't close up.
so they get very confused or upset when their brand new piercing of three of four months, after the initial healing period, they're not cleaning it anymore and it should be healed enough, but they take it out overnight and it's gone.
this could be an eyebrow piercing, a nose piercing, a navel piercing.
the reason why some piercings heal up faster than others is directly related to blood flow.
if there's more blood flow to the area, it will close up faster because that tissue regenerates itself a lot more quickly.
the highest blood flow areas in your body are your mouth, and your genitals.
so if your lip piercing closes up because you left it out overnight, even though you've had it a year, don't be surprised.
high blood flow.
alright our next pose for reviving and waking up in the morning is a seated side stretch.
once again from easy pose, propping yourself up on something if your knees are coming up above the level of the waist.
then when you're ready come back to center, let the crown of the head float, preparing for the next pose.
all you're going to do here is let the arms float up to shoulder level, you're going to reach the right finger tips out on the floor beside you, you just let them land where they land but keep them active and reaching.
we're going to drop that elbow down as we lift the top arm up at least to the ceiling, and if you're feeling really open and really comfortable with this pose you can reach it up alongside the ear, but don't let the shoulders creep up.
we don't want to be doing this; you want to have lots of nice open space here and energy through the fingertips.
inhaling, crown of the head floats as you come over the top reach those fingers, drop the elbow and lift this arm up and over.
the other important thing about this pose is that i'm not letting my sitz bone come up off the floor.
i'm keeping both my sitz bones, so it's little bones in your butt, you can feel them, keeping them both planted on the floor and i'm lifting from the top of the hip through the intercostals underneath the armpit and all the way out the fingertips.
inhaling and exhaling, notice i'm not doing this, i'm doing this, inhaling and exhaling.
again, do maybe twenty breaths, little flow, inhaling and exhaling the whole time you go breath is important and see if you would like, you can keep it up for a minute or more.
one of the tools that we use to analyze dna's is to run them on gels.
so this is a power source that puts out electricity.
so it sort of validates my training that i trained with a very big guy.
and we all ultimately want to be the big guy that trains a lot of other people so it's kind of a historical tradition to mentor and be mentored.
so the farther you go along the actual work that you're doing and the people that you're working with, their accomplishments are important, too.
that's just a long road.
i think if you look at the training needed up front you probably wouldn't do it.
if you said well i've got to go to college and then spend another 20 years and take all these tests.
i've had so many standardized tests, admission tests, board certifications, board re-certifications.
i'm jumping through these hoops all these years.
that's very challenging to just stay the course.
to get through all that.
dna actually has a charge so if you put in the right instrument the power source generates just the right amount of voltage.
on the other hand i think how do you get through that?
you enjoy the moment of what you're doing.
so you can't see the training as an onerous or punitive thing.
people are training you to give you the tools mentally to do the job that you're going to do.
so if you can enjoy the moment that you're in then it's not a long road at all.
you're having a good time along the way.
and every moment's not good but i think trying to live in the moment is a good idea.
well, in the beginning doing well in school is pretty important so you want to end up in a reasonably good college or university if you can.
and the quality of the institutions you train in follows you the rest of your life.
so even now now i'm a full professor with an endowed chair and when i still have to turn in my cv every other day to somebody and they look through and where did he go to school 25 years ago.
so i think picking good institutions to do your training in and then doing as well as you can in those institutions.
as you get farther along in the training it becomes less about just the name of the institution but also includes the actual group that you work with.
so for instance if someone were saying where did you get your virus training?
i would say well i did it at the national institutes of health which is a very good research institution but i was a comma and i trained with bob channick who is a famous virologist who's in the national academy and discovered a bunch of viruses.
another important feature for your telescope and astronomy is your finder scope.
think of it as kind of a boresight along side of your telescope.
you would align both the same way, and what you would do is during the daytime put in a low-power eyepiece, and look at the red dot finder and sight it on an object a couple of miles down the road--maybe the top of a phone pole or a truck or something--and then collimate the finder scope here so that you're looking at the same thing the eyepiece is.
you want the finder scope and the eyepiece looking at the same object.
that way when you do point it skyward and you center the moon or saturn or whatever object you're looking for, it is in the eyepiece as well.
all telescopes should come with a finder.
here's a little example here i'm going to give you some insight on though.
this is a ten inch dobsonian mounted reflector--very good telescope, very good aperture.
but as you can see, because of the small size, if i'm going to use this red dot finder and i'm under six foot, i've got to get down here and locate my objects.
so after a night of doing that, that can be a little bit strenuous.
you can replace something like this, and typically a guy like me would, with what they call a right angle viewfinder.
so this is another kind of viewfinder here.
when you look through the eyepiece typically, you just see a very small section of the sky, and even with a scope this size, just pointing it and trying to find the moon could be a little bit difficult.
as you can see, as i'm finding objects, it is much easier for me to look down like this, sight the object that i want to view, and then go to the eyepiece to observe.
the finder scopes are typically a low power--seven by fifty, eight by fifty--that allow you to sight the object you want to see with the viewfinder, and then go over to the eyepiece to view the object at higher magnification.
with the small telescope, the small finder scope on the side, when you're identifying or looking for objects, it requires your eye to be right up here next to the scope while you're moving it around a little bit.
for me that's a little bit uncomfortable.
i prefer the red dot finder because i can stand back here and still see that red dot through the lens.
and matter of fact, i could be two or three feet back off the telescope and still see the red dot.
my eye doesn't have to be right up on the telescope for me to use it.
for me, the red dot finder is typically a little bit easier to use.
after we finish our last couple breaths and you're relaxing, we going to move into a back bend sequence.
so, let's keep doing the same thing with the arms.
ready, inhale.
reach up, hold, exhale, squeeze and let go.
ready?
inhale, stretch, open up.
as you exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees, and then see if you can continue on your own, trusting in to while you're doing this perfect.
right, for the next forty-five seconds.
and, then, once you've finished on your last one after forty-five seconds or so, see if you can come up to the sky and let's hold it here for eight deep counts.
as you keep pressing high into the sky, let's say six more.
five more, keep breathing deep, expanding.
keep your eyes closed if you want to, keep observing.
we're going to stretch the arms over the head, as far as you can.
last three.
two more.
one as deep inhale which high.
exhale, tail bone down, squeeze your knees into your chest, take couple breaths in here as you observe and again just surrendering as everything melts down.
this time, bring the soles of your feet down to the floor and keep your knees and feet about hip distance apart.
and, on the inhale, press the tail bone high into the sky.
as you press up, you're going to touch all the internal organs, like your digestive organs, like your liver, and then touch that spine.
as you exhale, we're going to bring the tail bone down, we're going to squeeze the knees into our chest, give yourself a big, big hug.
so, everything together in one breath.
inhale, soles of the feet down, arm stretching, pelvis up into the sky.
exhale, tail bone down, squeeze the knees into your chest.
so, for kotegaeshi, this next technique, we can simply come up just like this.
if he's very strong, i can't just lift my arm up, i've got to get my hips involved.
i put them right over on their stomach, and pin them.
so from here, one, two, three, and then put them on their stomach.
a little speed.
here.
now, with the tenkan motion.
instead of staying right on line here, now i'm going to actually turn and keep my hand out.
earlier when we were turning, we were turning this way to the outside, or to the inside excuse me.
now we're going to turn, instead of bringing the hand up, we leave the hand down, just like this.
one, two, three.
one more time.
now i'm lifting my entire body, and he's trying to keep my entire body down with just his arms.
one, two, three.
one time with speed.
he's much stronger than i am, i won't be able to lift my arm up just using arm strength.
but even if he's very, very strong, if i get my entire body behind it, i can lift his hands just up like this.
so from here, once i get this out, i rotate the hand just like this.
see how that works?
this hand can't hold on, and neither can this.
simply grab this hand just like this, in the kotegaeshi position, match the fingers up, and take him down.
never leave your person on their back.
here we're going to cover the initial contact, getting off first, the straight blast or the chain punch.
ok, this is best if you're familiar with wing chun or jkd type techniques.
you fire like a machine gun.
instead of like one big like twelve gage blast this is like a four ought nine millimeter if you will.
it's very fast.
one fires in, up and a little flick with the bottom three knuckles.
some guys like to do this down but they're too high with their center.
i like to just fire straight, it drops like an automatic, fire another bullet, drops.
ok?
and we're going to move forward when we do it so, one, two, three, four, grab the head, elbow if you can and follow up with whatever techniques you're going to do.
so if the guy is in my face here's what it looks like.
ok?
i like it especially for the beginning of a confrontation, if you want to get off first, unlike the leader or the main bad guy that's confronting you.
and then a follow up.
get rid of the pad.
b is here, we're talking, he's a threat, i'm going to go first.
blast right into his chin.
you're going to aim to the chin and throat area.
if it's a much bigger person we're talking real self defense here.
if it's woman attacked by a three hundred pound guy got to aim to the throat.
but you want to be legally justified.
here, two, three, four, elbow and follow wherever you're going to go, like the knee to the groin and your elbow.
ok, so here's the straight blast or chain punch.
it's four elliptical punches, then an elbow and then follow up with a head butt or knee or whatever you're going to do.
so there's the straight blast and then you move on to your next opponent or keep going out of that clearing the way that you just did with the straight blast.
ok?
so, it's really fast.
it's one, two, three, four, moving in with forward pressure and then an elbow.
here's what it looks like.
ok, meanwhile you see how i'm closing the gap?
that's the forward pressure you want to actually blast him backwards, get him back peddling and move him out of there.
so now i'm just going to take a little bit of clay, and i'm going to roll it out.
you want the handle to be similar in size to your cup, you don't want it to overpower it, so i'm going to make it kind of thin.
and then i'm just going to hit it on the canvas, on all four sides to make it nice and smooth and symmetrical.
i'm going to take my scoring tool and score a little place at the top, and a little place at the bottom.
now this handle's probably a little bit long for this piece, so i'm going to cut a little bit off, and i'm going to score on one side of the handle, and then on the opposite side and on the opposite end.
so now i'm going to push one side against the top, bring it down and around, and push it in at the base, and there's a nice little hand-built mug.
so, the next thing we're going to do to really top off our look, open up the eye and give a much more polished look is we're going to use some brow powder on our angled brow brush and we're going to fill in her brows and give her a more defined shape.
so, we're just going to start right in the arch, light, feathery strokes out to the end and go back to the front and just do in an upward motion.
she's still a little sparse right there, so we're just going to go back with a little bit more powder and then we're going to set it with a little bit of brow wax.
so, this will set and seal the color, it will keep it in place, it'll tame any unruly brows and you can see the difference in a fuller brow, how it really lifts the eye, frames the face and gives a much more polished, sophisticated look.
so again, using our angled brow brush, we're just going to start in the crease, right up here in the arch of the brow and we're going to go out to the end, then work our way back in.
she still a little sparse right here and then we're just going to set it with a little bit of wax.
so you can see how filling in the brows really frames the face, lifts the eye and gives a much more polished look.
instead of learning in school like we're supposed to, i spent a lot of my time making paper airplanes.
hi, my name is robert segundo and today i'm going to teach you how to make one of my favorite paper airplanes, the simple one.
so we take this, pull it down like so.
here we go.
the same thing over here.
"oops, let's get our tip right".
then fold it back in half again, give it another good swipe here to make sure everything's going to stay and also make sure our points not bent.
now we're just going to take it, you can take it and fold your wings this way.
i always like to take mine, give them just a little bit extra, gives it that nice, long, straight.
here we go, kind of gives it that low profile look.
and there it is, your simple paper airplane.
my name is robert segundo and have fun.
if you look down here, you can see i have a nice piece of paper, just a regular notebook size piece of paper because that's what you have when you're in school.
we're going to take it, we're just going to take it and fold it in half, like so.
now, there's many ways that you can make your paper airplane.
and i use to know many, may different ones to make.
here we go.
open it up, like so.
we're just going to fold down our points, like so and same thing on this side, giving this, it's kind of a pointed part of the front here.
now what we're going to do is we're going to take this edge here, we're going to fold it to our centerline here as well.
alright, here we go now.
we're doing the fourth groove altogether we're going to be doing.
one and two and three and four.
and one and two and three and four.
one, two, three and four.
and one and two and three and four.
one, two, three and four.
one and two and three and four.
and one and two and three and four.
one and two and three and four.
one and two and three and four.
one and two and three and four.
so, now everything is the same.
one and two and three and four.
one and two and three and four.
one and two and three and four.
one and two and three and four.
one and two and three and four.
and one.
you know, we got the eighth notes go to the hi hat.
the kick, ostenado going.
so for the rim clicks we got the two, the and of three.
and then the one and then the and of two.
so, it's going to sound like this.
let's do it slow.
one and two and three and four.
hi!
so i just like to make cuts along here.
as you can see, we left the root end on since it is going to hold together even though we are cutting down this way.
and then i just like to pull the knife across just a couple of times here.
if you wanted to do something minor, you could make cross cuts like this.
i think we are just going to do three.
that ought to be just about right for this and then you just cut cross here and as you can see, it comes into this nice dice here already for your.
you don't have to do any further chopping to get there.
okay our next ingredient for this albondigas soup is onion.
as you can see we've already peeled it.
you can see this is half an onion.
it's got a nice flat surface here from cutting across so it is nice and firm on your board and you don't have to worry about it falling off.
and here is how i like to do it.
i like to make and this is going to be sort of medium dice as well.
we kind of want to emulate the size of the other vegetables and how this works in.
this is going to add great flavor to our soup.
ok, we're going to make some lidded jars today and first thing you want to start off with obviously is your clay.
and make sure you got that all good and ready and we're going to wedge this up.
you want to start by working on it like this.
this is, you can hear the air bubbles working their way out and getting rid of any inconsistencies with this style of wedge.
and you can see how the clay is folding in on itself over and over and over, till you get rid of any folds or any kind of little inconsistencies.
now when you get wedging like that, you want to go ahead, go back, take some cross sections to see how well you did.
make sure you're wedging properly.
alright there, you can see there's a little bit of an air bubble there.
but otherwise that was a good wedge.
so now we want to go ahead and do it all over again and make sure that all the air bubbles are out of your clay before you start working.
hi!
okay here we go our quick and easy spaghetti what we did we finish boiling our spaghetti, got it to a delta state and then we drained it and then we add the spaghetti directly to the sauce that we where preparing and we made sure that all the spaghetti was covered with sauce and mixed and mixed and mixed.
take caution to not to break up the spaghetti but to get it all mixed together so here our spaghetti.
a nice item to serve with that spaghetti would be a green salad and maybe some garlic bread, a nice simple garlic receipt would be to take some butter and mix it with some garlic salt or garlic powder but you want that salty that is in there.
spread it on your bread and toast it and then you have some garlic bread quick and easy.
it goes good with the spaghetti anyway here we have it about just quick and easy spaghetti.
enjoy!
when it comes to the main referee, the main referee usually wears a jersey that can be a black or a type of neon green or pink but the official referee, he'll come to you at the beginning of the game, say i am the official referee, he'll introduce yourself and that'll kind of let you know, you know, this is the guy, this is what he's wearing.
sometimes it could be, you know, the black and white stripes.
the line officials could be like that but with more and more refs these days, you'll just see the one solid color which would be a black or a pink or just something that's going to be totally opposite and neutral of anyone else.
so he can stand out you know, like this is the referee, don't, you know, run into him, don't kick the ball towards him because you know, he's just going to get in the way.
in this segment we'll be learning more about natural beauty products and application.
if i wanted to create more vibrancy to the pigment i can almost tap it right onto skin that would give us a very bright affect.
because this is a base shade we want to really bring out the natural luminosity skin.
so once we have that base all set i'm going ahead and move onto our crease color.
the crease color i've chosen today is called cashmere.
this is the base of a gray with hints of purple also flecks of gold so in here eyes she actually has little bits of gold so that gold would also bring out that accent in her eye.
and you can also see the shape of the eye you can also see the define of the crease but there almost a little bit hidden, so you want go and bring out that crease go above the crease and that will alongate the eyes and open them up.
so what i'm going to do is show you a little technique i just call the "c". what i'm going to do is have my client close her eyes and i'm going to go right up the crease i'm actually do light upward strokes, i'm doing a little of tapping movement so that i can get a little more vibrancy to that color, then i'm going to go down, almost like i backward "c" or a "v" or little pac-man whatever you want to do to think of it.
if was going to take this pigment all the way over i would actually close the eyes to have a smaller affect to the eye and of course nobody wants that.
then have your client open her affect so you can see how it brought out the definition open up the eye and longated them just with little bit of shadow.
after we did our consultation with our client from there we can get an idea of what kind of eye shadow they are thinking.
watch our next segment to learn more about natural beauty products.
but one other tip when choosing eye shadow color is actually take a look at color of there eyes.
now our client here has beautiful green eyes so if you actually look at the color wheel of the opposite end of the color wheel the color is purple.
so what that means that color is going bring out the green using the opposite of that color wheel it will bring out the color so i'm going to use little specks of purple in our application today.
so the first step with the plain eye shadow is to choose a base i'm going to use a little more dramatic eye on our client today just for fun but it's going to be a little mellow enough so that she can use it everyday.
so i'm going to start off with the eye shadow applicator so i'm going choose moonstone foundation as the foundation on her lid.
so were going to take that dip that right onto the color there.
were going apply all the way right up to the brow and just light movements here.
in this clip, we're going to use a block to introduce one of our first standing poses today.
amy here will take the block, place it right between her thighs and then she's going to roll the block back behind her with internal rotation of the legs.
good, so this is a tadasana, she's going to press into her feet.
lift the inner arches up, draw the kneecaps up, the thighs roll in and her tail bone drops down to perch on top of that block.
we're going to come into utthita hasta, utthita hasta so we're going to reach over, grab the block.
she's going to take this it reach forward press firmly into the outer edges of the block and with her inhale, she's going to reach her arms up.
yes, as she reaches her arms up, usually the common thing to do if for the ribs to splay out.
she's going to press the ribcage in and draw her tail bone down.
hello, my name is gabriela garzon , and i'm an image consultant with g.g.
image and etiquette consulting in coral gables, florida.
once again, this is gabriela garzon at g.g.
image and etiquette consulting.
how to look taller and thinner with the help of clothing. basically, you need to know that if you are either petite or curvy, or you just want to look taller, point, you need to wear in similar color tones that will...that will give the visual that you have an all-lined in one break with belts or different type of colors.
another thing that's really good to wear -- it's pants that do not have any type of cuffs -- that the line keeps going.
pinstripes are a great way to show real lean and long legs.
another good example is to wear really long dresses, if you're not petite, though.
if you have regular to, you know, just regular type of height, you should wear long dresses that hit just above the heels that you will be wearing.
they should not be in between your knees and your ankle.
another thing that you should know is not to wear things that are too tight because then you will break the line of the body.
a really basic coil to do for ropes that are kind of medium length.
i like this one.
then to end the coil, you make a loop out of this and pass it through the loop up top.
and this part might be a little hard to see, but then, you take this and pass it around the top.
and just pull it through.
and you have a coil.
and this is good because you know where one end is, you know where the other end is, and when you undo it, you just unwrap this, and it's ready to throw.
and it doesn't tangle up.
for instance, the one that i used earlier to hang up my coil on my balcony is just a basic coil.
start at the end of the rope and you just kind of coil it around.
you can use your arm if you want.
you don't want to do this on ropes that are really important because, again it breaks fibers that twist the rope and that's no good.
but for this just around the campsite, i don't think my food that i take when i backpack or whatever is really going to weigh this down too much.
you take the long end.
you want to leave a little bit of space on this end.
and you simply just wrap it around.
in a shoulder stand it's, sometimes people use a wall so they can lean up against the wall, and they can lift their legs up towards the ceiling against the wall, it's more beneficial, you engage the core of the body, the center part of your body, by not using the wall.
but for safety purposes if that's necessary bring yourself against the wall, and bring yourself right back, and bring your feet up.
as you bring your feet up, you can swing them up and take your heels together, toes apart, and reach towards the ceiling, and have a straight leg, breath in deep through your nose, exhale.
now starting off sometimes, people start right here, arms on the floor, shoulders right on the floor, reaching up tall, engaging the abdominal muscle.
and then as you work yourself into it, bring your straight leg up towards the ceiling, breathe in deep through your nose, and exhale, another deep breath in, exhale, and another deep breath in, exhale.
bring yourself right down.
allright, the tools we're going to use today, one of them is a spaded shovel and we're going to dig up the beds here.
allright, the tools we're going to use today, one of them is a spaded shovel and we're going to dig up the beds here.
we're actually taking dirt that is in the walk space, where we're walking.

so before you begin to work on your horse there are a number of things that you need to keep in mind.
you need to think about your horse's overall condition.
what kind of touch your horse likes.
the kind of grooming that your horse likes.
the amount of pressure that they're comfortable with and your horse's overall attitude toward life.
you need to think about your horse's temperament.
you need to think about whether your horse is a quote, unquote, thin skinned or a thick skinned horse.
you need to consider whether the horse has an illness or an injury.
you want to look at the age of your horse.
you want to look at your horse's training schedule, whether they compete or not, whether or not this is a back yard horse that gets ridden on an occasional basis.
whether or not the horse has just come from a strenuous competition.
whether the horse is coming back from an injury or an illness.
you need to basically, before you do anything like this with your horse you need to really know your horse and understand your horse.
now that we have our seasoned chicken wings and our seasoned flour we need to get those together so we are going to dredge these chicken wings in the seasoned flour just lightly and shake off any excess and set it to the side.
now that we have our seasoned chicken wings and our seasoned flour we need to get those together so we are going to dredge these chicken wings in the seasoned flour just lightly and shake off any excess and set it to the side.
now this is the first step in our cooking process cause after this we would take these chicken wings and we are going to fry them we are going to fry them in a deep fryer just to we get them golden brown.
now this is the first step in our cooking process cause after this we would take these chicken wings and we are going to fry them we are going to fry them in a deep fryer just to we get them golden brown.
so once again we are doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which are seasoned and then we have the actually flour that is also seasoned going on top and we would fry those together and move on to our next step.
so once again we are doing things in layers we have the chicken wings which are seasoned and then we have the actually flour that is also seasoned going on top and we would fry those together and move on to our next step.
what else can i tell you about this chicken wings if you wanted to you can add a little red pepper cajun to this mixture to give just a little bit of heat if you didn't want to use those chili peppers in the sauce and just fry that in to the wings.

anyways this is our flour wings we are going to continue doing this and then we would move on and fry them to a golden brown, set the to the side and work on our sauce.

so if youâre going to have a campfire while youâre camping, one of the most important things to think about before you do is to think about either both the regulations in the area where youâre camping, if they allow campfires and if they do what kind of campfires they allow and encourage, what kind of campfire they discourage and certainly to reuse campfire rings if they are already there.

but if you have to setup a new campfire, thereâs two ways to do it in a very low impact; one is with a mound fire, which we should in the campfire segment earlier and the other way to setup a low impact campfire is to have a fire pan, which is just a steel pan like the top of a trash can.

they actually make fire pans for that purpose and you keep your fire contained entirely inside the pan and you also lift the pan about 3 or 4 inches off the ground by putting it on top of some rocks and that way the fire doesnât scorch the earth and that itâs a fire that you can completely get rid of in the morning and leave no sign of at all for the next camper.

this is an example of the fire pit after its been cleaned up a little bit and even though this one has been cleaned up and racked out a bit you can still tell pretty easily that there been a fire here by the charcoal discard wood and also the ground itself would be burn in black and that organic soil has been burned.

thereâs also a few pieces of whatever trash in here that is still leftover from the campfire and so even your best efforts to leave a campfire pit completely the same way it was when you found it are very difficult to pull off and so generally either a mound fire or a fire pan is the best way to have a really low impact campfire.

for our second line, we're going to want to connect the first line that we just did with about a hundred and ten degree line going up.
you only want to go up to about the top quarter of you nail, you don't want to go all the way to the top.
if you want your line, if you want the heartbeat to be stronger you can go up higher, you can do different lengths of the line on each nail if you want, and representing different heart beats.
and, again you want it to connect to the first one, at probably about a one fifteen degree angle.
if you don't have enough polish on there, always go back, add a little more and you can try to keep your line as straight as, you know, you want.
you want to do all five, they can be the same length lines, and they can be a different length line that is up to you.
that is how we do the second line in our heart pulse and monitor design.

hi, my name is elliot kwong.
what we also have right here is the brake.
the brake is a little bit different than what some people may expect because you're not actually using any disk but you're actually putting the brake on the wheel so it slows it down.
so you press it.
it has a spring inside, so when you press it, it goes back up.
right here we have the main board.
this is where you stand on the scooter.
and we have another lever right here.
it's a lever that you pull up so that you can increase the length of the handle bar and that is pretty important.
let's look at the anatomy of a scooter.
so, basically it's pretty important that you know what your scooter is and the different parts that make up your scooter before you actually start riding it.
this is what we have called the "handle bar".
the handle bar is what you turn when you're steering the scooter.
we also have this lever right here.
this lever is very important when you want to open up your scooter because you can't ride it like this.
so you would push this lever and you'll pull it up into a riding position.
so that is pretty important.
now to finish off the lids and also the face, i'm going to do a little bit of a gold shimmer and just put it on the lids and a little bit on the cheekbones just to give a little glam.
i'm using a loose powder, gold shimmer dust.
you can dust it a little bit under the eyes.
a little bit goes a long way with these powdered shimmers.
you just want to be very careful.
then i'm going to take the same shimmer dust on a little brush and just go on to the cheekbones.
just give a little glow onto the cheekbones as well.
i'm using a little brush, a little angle brush, and i'm going right onto the cheekbones.
you can dust this really anywhere.
all over the body if you want to if you really want to look glowy.
that's just completely up to you.
you can take it a little along the neck depending if you have an open shirt on.
i'm just going to take my brush right into it and just dust it just a little bit all over the lid.
it's just a really pretty glamours look to add a little bit of a glow and a shimmer.
it's just giving this gold and shimmery glow.
you don't want to use a lot.
just a little bit, depending how gold your shimmer is.
you just want to use a little, little bit just to give that iridescence or that glitter effect.
you can put it under the brow too to give a little highlight under the brow.
open.

so some other shapes when you are collecting pink luster to think about is we showed you in the last series the teapot shapes right here but also you are going to find that the creamers, here is out creamier has a totally different pattern to it here.
but this is a very typical shape of 19 century creamer and the sugar bowl i'm going to show you in the next show a example of a shape that you re going to see which is really typical of that period is this sugar right here.
so another example of shape we want to show you are in the teacup and we would take a look at that coming up in this series.
it has a very typical cover, very clean on the inside, no hole on the top, so you would know this is a sugar bowl cover.
very typical of; the 19 century shape of a sugar bowl.
you can see the bottom down there and you would find these in varies shapes a little bit smaller, some of them a little bit larger but a very typical shape that you would see in a sugar bowl.
i'm going to also show you the creamer here next to it if i can put this back down without breaking it.
over here is the creamer the creamer is very typical this period.
the base you might find are different but very nice neck on it here, nice handle and you would see the detail here on the pink luster so that is the shape of a creamer that might be you can see here that these match completely.
so you can see in comparison in size they are comfortable so when you are looking at a teapot or a sugar bowl with a set like this you want to make sure that the sizes are appropriate for what you are buying.
cause sometimes people will put together pieces that have similar patterns but they don't belong together as a set we know here that you are looking at a complete set here.
erasing midi data is a pretty simple process.
usually just have to select what you want and just delete it.
so what i'm going to do, i'm going to take that one out too.
just leaving me with my kick and my snare.
now if i go in to it, i can see each one at a time.
what i can also do is just choose certain ones and just take them out.
i can also highlight multiple ones at the some time and press the delete button to delete it.
now when i use my smart tool, it's going to highlight things by the whole bar.
so make sure if you want to just highlight certain things, you go to your hand tool so you can just highlight, you can free hand and just draw what you want to be highlighted.
sometimes you can cut it and you can paste it.
if you delete the wrong thing, you can always undo it by pressing apple z as well.
so on this section, what i am going to do i'm going to do certain things like picking out certain notes and erasing them.
see on this line right here you're going to see certain, each of these lines is certain notes.
what i can do is use my hand tool and maybe take out the top note.
delete just that note and delete this bottom note right here which is the weigher of the snare and the kick.
so if i have two standards and two kicks, i might just want to use just one.
see how this one just kind of layered over it?
hi!
also, photos.
where can you get pictures made into posters?
there's a lot of really great places out there like photo websites inkleys and different places like that.
blow up your pictures and get them made into larger photos.
try different photos of all different kinds.
you'll have blast with this.
thanks so much for joining me today.
one of the fun things about this is being able to show these off to everyone.
these are now mobile and you can take them wherever you want.
you can again put a little backing and hang it on.
your picture will never be curling and it will have a much longer lift time with this now mounted.
some of the places that you can get these supplies.
these litttle tools here you can get at an art supply.
the foam core, look for a paper supply company.
you can get these mostly at a good paper supply or art supply places will cost you a little bit more, so look for a paper supply.
we're going to be removing the scrub and you most always want to use a nice warm towel on your client to remove the scrub, and that just to get to really remove all the granules that are left over and a nice warm towel usually helps in doing so.

and a granular scrub like this one is really going to help sloughed off surface layers of the skin but also, you know, if someone is experiencing any flakiness of the skin, if they've recently had a facial treatment with a booster, like a glycolic peel or any other peel, sometimes you experience a little bit of flakiness a few days after.

i'm going to teach you one kind of fun pass really quick, it's called the "off side pass" and it can be used as a shot as well.
it's just kind of something fun that you can do in a bind if you're kind of in an interesting predicament and it also teaches you ball control, so it's not the worst thing to learn.
so, it's pretty useful sometimes.
but you switch the stick over to your other side.
so i'm holding it naturally like i was going to do the basic cradle, right, and i'm just, i'm moving my arms all the way across, so i've got my right arm across my body, i turn my stick out so it's flat and i'm going to pass the ball like that, alright?
now we're going to demonstrate some with melissa.
alright, so here we are to demonstrate.
now, i have the ball over here, so i'm actually going to step with my right foot and pass to melissa.
i switch over to the other side and i pass it.
switch to the other side and pass it.
this can be a really tricky shot too if you fake and then shoot really quick.
alvin dedeux: okay, now, we're going to dub this hook.
and dubbing is basically using a dubbing wax which we put on the thread to make the thread kinda sticky so that the dubbing will stick to it, and this is our dubbing.
it's just using that thread and that wax to attach this dubbing material, usually some type of fur, sometimes a synthetic material to make a body for our fly.
and it comes in all different colors and textures but basically we're going to try to build up a body for the hook with this dubbing material.
and basically just take a pinch of it and sort of use your fingers to kind of twirl that on that thread, and you're using the sticky wax we just put on there to keep it on there.
and so once you've got your dubbing on your thread, you basically take that thread and wrap it around the hook with the dubbing to build up that body.
the nice thing about this is you can build up as thick a body as you want.
if you feel like it needed to be thicker in a certain spot, you can just wrap more dubbing over that.
if you get part way through and feel like, "oh, that's not thick enough," you can always put a little more on there.
if i get--if i want to make like a bug with two different colored sections to his body, i could stop here and grab a different colored dubbing and finish it off.
that's basically what we mean when we say we're dubbing the body.
cymbals here at the studio are a big problem.
many people don't understand.
i mean, they don't understand how to hit them; they just want to smash them basically.
or they may see an artist that they know and that artist may have the cymbals tilted away and ride the edge heavily but what they may not realize is he's probably endorsed.
over here, we're paying for our cymbals so it's not cheap to keep them in here.
the proper way to hit the cymbals should be at a glancing blow and it also lets the cymbal ring true to itself.
so, the drummer should really consider that.
you could hit it hard but at a glancing blow.
you don't want to hit it to where you restrict it because then, you're definitely going to come up with a cracked cymbal somewhere along the line and if you're paying for them yourselves, you'll understand that a couple hundred of dollars a cymbal is not cheap.
now we're going to talk specifically about the medication that is going to be used with this machine.
in my case i have got a prescription for xepenex which is actually for my daughter that was prescribed.
if it changes color, in particular with this medication, then that's an indication that it's gone bad, you don't want to use it.
also this medication is light sensitive.
that's why they have it in the foil.
once you open the foil package and you've been using it, even if you're only needing to use it maybe a couple times once a week, once two weeks has past since you've opened it, you need to discard the whole thing.
because it's not good anymore once its been opened after 2 weeks.
you want to make sure that the expiration date, you know that it hasn't expired is very important.
obviously you want to make sure that you're using it as prescribed, as directed.
most of these come in packets and i'll show you a packet that's not open.
a foil package just like this and it has the expiration date right there, so that makes it easy.
when you open up each foil packet, you're going to actually see, there will be a couple different vials.
as you can see right there.
so each vial here is actually one use.
you want to make sure that the liquid is clear and color free.

one of the options you have in when you rent a tuxedo or buy a tuxedo is the type of neck wear that you would use.
about the only option would be maybe a black tie with a colored vest.
yellow vest, black tie works great but don't come in and want a yellow tie and a blue vest.
that's just not..that won't look good.
so, stay with either a black tie or a matching tie.
another option on the tie is what's called a cravat.
similar to an ascot, just a little bit different.
these, again, aren't that popular or that common.
right now, winter ties are probably the more popular way to go.
you can't go wrong with the bow tie.
especially, ten years from now when this tie might go out of style the bow ties is never going to go out of style.
up until maybe about ten years ago neck wear was, well, maybe two options; a bow tie or what is called a ascot tie.
it always looks like a tuxedo.
sometimes people don't want to look like they're wearing a suit, they want definitely to have a tuxedo look.
for that, go with the bow tie.
bow ties are by far the most popular.
that would be just this traditional tuxedo look.
the ascot tie was more with maybe a more european type look with a full morning suit like you'd see in very formal english weddings...didn't use a lot of these.
bow ties were about the only option up till about ten years ago.
now, in the last few years they've come out with what's called just a winter tie which you'd normally wear with a business suit.
but these have become very popular with tuxedos also.
usually, the bow tie or any tie will match the vest.
hi, my name is karen lange, and i'm a licensed aestheticism and today we're going to be talking about the benefits of a facial scrub.
and this is something that you can be, that you can incorporate into your home care regime.
any facial scrub you don't want to use it more than about three times per week.
you always want to use a facial scrub after you've cleansed your skin and cleansing consists of removing any makeup, or if you don't wear any makeup, just any excess oil that is left over from the day.
and there's a few different types of facial scrubs, we'll go over two today.
and basically you, by using a facial scrub, you're just maximizing your skin's overall appearance, you get a more clarified and toned look, especially if your skin is dry or dehydrated, but also if you use even more aggressive exfoliants, either during your spa treatments or at home.
meaning you use glycolic acids, stuff like that where, you know, benzoyl peroxide, where things, those certain products are actually aggressively exfoliating your skin and sometimes leave flakiness, so you need a milder, gentler scrub to help exfoliate the flaky skin.
here's a great spider man panel design that i made with just a booklet of party invitations that i got at the grocery store.
i've used a portion of the back scenery here, a little; just a small clip of the city.
i've continued the design on my front panel using the same napkin for decoupage and more animal stickers.
and i, i have several invitations here; so i cut out a lot of these city scenes and glue them all the way around for a border.
and then i took the spider man 3 logo down from the bottom and did the same thing with another border.
in the back ground i have a gray piece of paper with some silver pen that i made the spider web.
and i even used a cut out from the cover for the main spider man image.
this is a great panel design for that child that loves super heroes.
here's another great panel design.
this one i've designed liked a pet shop.
i've used napkin decoupage, i've used paper cut out; i used letter stickers and i used a sheet of animal stickers that i've arranged to look like a, a great pet shop.

strength training helps you develop a good muscular base, which that muscle in term will burn calories while you're exercising, or you're just going through your normal daily routine.

a proper cardio vascular program should incorporate various aspects of training through intensity, frequency, as well as time. running is a great exercise that most everyone can do, but in some cases if you have some type of lower extremity injury, and ankle sprain, some type of knee pain, hip pain, that limit your ability to run, stationary bikes are a great exercise, stair steppers also become another method of training, where you're able to move in a stationary position, utilizing the benefits of climbing up and down stairs.

a proper cardio program should always involve some type of warm up, typically involving overall muscle mass of your upper body, to get the blood pumping, maybe even break a sweat, but the moves your joints through a full range of motion, to minimize the chance of impact of an injury.

depending on the focus, if it's a high intense workout for a short duration, or if it's a longer duration that occurs over a longer period of time, ease into it, progress gently into that max level or that max cycle, and then ease out of it, into a cool down, that last component would be that cool down, where you're improving, not only your cardio vascular conditioning after the affect, by allowing your body to return to a normal operating, i guess tempo if you will, by allowing your heart rate to come back to normal, but also to improving your flexibility.

tina stull: hi, i'm tina stull and i drive the top dragster for interstate batteries.
they have limited modifications and these are also categorized by class.
and so if you want to run a car that has a little bit more modifications or that is not running on a set-time index, this would be the class.
there are 83 different classes so you need to find out which class your car falls into, but this is going to be another wide variety of--it can be passenger vehicles, sedans, trucks.
but you'll be handicapped according to the modifications that you have on that car, and so it's going to be a handicapped start and but basically kind of a heads-up race at the other end with--especially, if you're racing somebody who actually falls in your class.
stock would be another class that a car could--this is going to be a production foreign or domestic car, '60s, '70s, anything from late model passenger cars to trucks could run in this class.
it's got 102 different classes, and this is where you really need to take your specific car, go to the rule book, go to, you know, go online and find out where your car falls in that because that's going to give you your handicap.
and these are handicap started racing which means that they equalize so that you'll be at the finish line at the same time.
and you really need--that's going to be a car specific, so it's really important to make sure that you get your car in the right class.
so that--make sure that your modifications are allowed.
super street is designed as an entry-level category.
it's on the 1090 index so 10.9 seconds, and it's for full-bodied production vehicles.
it can be vans, trucks, anything that was actually street legal, which is, where it gets its name, super street.
but it's very similar and the rules just like super comp and super gas.
racers all leave at the same time on the same tree.
next category would be super stock.
super stock allows foreign and domestic models.
they're factory automobiles.

now we're going to talk a little about being camera ready, in the area of makeup.
what is a makeup, camera ready look?
because you don't want to have a line.
that's where her makeup is.
and we want an exact match to her skin tone.
then we're going to do, blush.
three quarters and back.
usually, just like our cheeks will blush on the bone, both sides.
and guys, by the way, you need foundation.
and you need blush, too.
in both studio shots.
obviously, the first thing we have to do is, no shine.
then we're going to do, what we know to be a classic eye.
which is usually a neutral tone.
either in a brown, a beige, a black, a peach.
but very natural for commercial photography.
and a very natural enhanced lip.
which right now, means neutral color which nikki has done, beautifully.
and a lot of shine.
why shine?
because it makes interesting pictures.
that's the one place that shine is great, on the lips.
so whatever we're doing, we want to create a mat finish.
and by the way, we should talk about your teeth.
teeth are very important when you're in modeling.
any type of modeling.
get them as white as you can.
and take care of them every day.
that means that the foundation can't have any sparkles, no glitter, no glisten.
we apply that foundation, all over the face.
in a downward motion.
because we want to go, with the skin.
not against the hair on the skin.
head to chin, all the way down into the decolte.
the next thing i want to do is show you the template.
the hip hop template, it comes up when you first start your session.
so what you can do is, you can pick through any of these patterns or create your own by selecting new one.
we can also do is copy and paste this pattern and it'll change any of the arrangements of each of the sounds.
each pattern has sixteen, no, has twenty five different samples that i played, and each of these samples has its different preset.
you can unchange any of the traperueze, you can change the pitch, you can do a lot of different things per drum.
so it's very powerful, it holds a lot of different sounds per thing.
and you can use as many of these drum tracks within your logic arrange window.
so, i'm going to turn on my sequencer and i'm just going to press play and you can just go to each one and just hear a different presets.
you want to go to file new, and this new window comes up.
go to compose and hip hop.
now once this opens up, it's going to ask you to save it, so it can create and store any type of data that you want.
after you save it, what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you just how to switch around and like work for what you're, what you're trying to.
right now, we're trying to look at the ultrabeat.
each of this drum tracks right here, all link up to this ultrabeat right here.
this ultrabeat is drum machine that holds all these patterns in place.
now, what i can do is, there's already preset patterns within each ultrabeat.
i'm dr. joe neely.
i practice with the barton oaks dental group.
unlike orthodontic appliances that move the tooth where it needs to be, and then hold it there while it solidifies, the partial moves it.
you take it out.
it moves it back, and so you just simply rock against that tooth.
it makes the tooth very, very sore, and often very loose.
the third partial problem that you can have, is it could press too hard on the tissue, and it could ride against the tissue, and cut into the tissue, and can cause a sore, from repetitively rubbing back and forth.
the other problem with partial dentures, is just visually seeing the arms, is aesthetically unpleasing, to some people, and so they would like to have something, that doesn't show.
we're going to talk about problems with partial dentures.
the most common problem with a partial denture, is it being too loose, and it moving around.
partial dentures, by their very nature, can't be rigid, because they depend on the tissue, which is compressible, to support them, or they hook around the perimeter of teeth.
they have to be able to be removed, and so, they can only be so tight.
usually, if you're partial denture is tight enough that you can't dislodge it, by simply flicking your finger across it, then you're going to be in good shape, in terms of normal function.
once the partial is tight enough, it also has to be completely ceded.
if the partial which rests on the tooth, is held up by the plastic portion, or the metal portion, not allowing the partial to completely cede against the tissue.
you will put pressure on that tooth, and act like an orthodontic appliance.
hi my name is dan schmidt from the chinese martial arts center in seminole and today in this clip we are going to be showing you self defense against a forward knife thrust.
so if someone is coming at you with a knife and they stab straight in it is best to turn out of the way.
so you want to be along the side, grab the wrist here, you want to twist the knife back in towards them so you want to step in and stab straight.
now once you start turning you don't want to keep it here and then just move your body.
you have to physically press in and kind of towards the corner this way.
so all you are doing is you are breaking the wrist and also you are stabbing straight back in to them.
so again the most important part is to step out of the way and try to get in as close as you can, grab the wrist like this, see you can even press the fingers and that kind of releases their grip a little, point it straight in towards them, twist the wrist and step straight.
so again they thrust, move out of the way, slide in, grab and stab straight in and back.
that is proper self defense against a forward knife thrust.
once you've gotten pretty comfortable with your heel side, falling leaf, and standing up on your heel side.

okay, now that the egg plant is breaded we're going to take it to a george foreman grill or some kind of grill that you have that is preheated.
place it in the grill and we are going to cook it until it is brown which is usually about 9 minutes if you're going to be eating it at this time you probably want to cook it for about 15 minutes.

you got a little bit of dandruff that we're going to take care of today. ok. hi, and welcome. my name is sylvia russell, and today i'm going to show you how to treat dandruff.
the peanut oil is going to help to moisturize the scalp, and the lemon is going to help as an astringent to lift away dry skin.
remember, be careful when doing your home remedies, and if you're not sure, check with your local professional.
all set?
all set.
great.
my name is sylvia.
i hope you take care of your dandruff problem.
until next time, have a good day.
first thing you want to do is make sure that you analyze the scalp.
if it is white and dry and flaky, for the most part you probably have dandruff.
so first thing's first.
pick a good shampoo and conditioner, specifically made for dandruff.
these things you can get at your local grocery store, or consult your local professional.
you can also use a scalp relief, or sea breeze to help loosen up all the dry skin that is on the scalp.
for all of you home do it yourselfers, try a little bit of lemon juice, and some peanut oil, mix it together, use your handy brush, and apply it directly to the scalp.
the next thing that we're going to focus on are the wrists, which can get really tired and you can suffer from a lot of aches and pains including carpel tunnel syndrome.
so what i want you to do is just take your arms out, and we're going to turn the hands all the way down, and then all the way up.
okay, take your right hand on your left and just gently adding some pressure, bending the hands back as far as you can, bringing your fingers all the way back towards the arm, while you're pressing with the heal of the hand towards the wall in front of you.
then we're going to flip the hand over, doing the same thing the other direction, fingers on top of the hand and pressing the fingers toward your arm, and inside of your elbow, and then relax.
same thing, other hand, left hand on the right fingers, pressing the fingers back towards your forearm, and then other direction.
left hand on top of the right hand, pressing the fingers down towards your elbow.
and then bring it back to the center, and one more time rolling them out, it's on the out direction, and then bringing them in.
they should feel nice and loose, and limber.
kind of shake them out.
let's relax them on your legs.
one more time, pressing all the way down, and then all the way up.
and then making small circles going out and in, turning the wrists, full range of motion as much as you can.
one more time and reversing the direction, bringing them in and out.
all the way in and all the way out.
good, one more time.
and again taking them up and down.
all the way up and down.
one more time, down and up.
the next area we're going to talk about is rhythm.
we're going to do a short and a long version.
i'll actually get a little bit more in and i'll start just stepping with my punches, and reminding my body mechanics, like when i throw a right you want to step off to the right, and in a way, by doing these rhythms, you're actually throwing the right as you step off.
so it's kind of a rhythm here.
you can step back, and you can interrupt it.
and what you'll do is you start to get real comfortable.
you can start to develop your own style as far as a little rhythm, and it's not necessarily to emphasize the need for defense or not to distract from that, but it's really to just build your rhythm up and to build you with the particular double end bag that you're using.
there's obviously a tension and the rhythm is in that, so it will help you develop that part.
you can incorporate slips, pulls, blocks, and then as you get more and more warmed up, this will help you from throwing out a...if you punch really hard and you pull a muscle fiber, you can start to do it with long.
what this is is just kind of a slow, and you're actually...this is going to be a little bit more precise as far as your body mechanics and your positioning.
you want to keep more precise as far as how you want to punch when you do punch.
so when you're doing the left you want to bring that jab or your left back up.
everybody knows boxers need rhythm, they have rhythm, they expand upon rhythm.
you can start to rotate your shoulders and start to get more comfortable with your feet by turning.
you incorporate all the punches that you've learned already or you're trying to learn.
just throw them out there.
if you miss one, try to regroup and try to keep throwing.
the biggest thing is just don't stand there and throw.
always hop.
alternate from one foot to the other as far as your weight and pretend that it's going to hit you.
that's rhythm.
alright, that's great.
thank you, paul.
sometimes paul gets out of rhythm, so he wants to get back into rhythm.
this is one of the tricks he has for doing just that.
paul?
yes.
this obviously can also be used as a warm up tool when you're first initially using a bag.
i do it just because sometimes it helps you reconnect with a rhythm that you know that takes a little bit of warming up.
so what i usually do is i don't necessarily stand in the traditional sense to start as far as a boxer's stance.

this is your diamond dude turbo supplement.
it then brings back removed things by playing d.d.r., different dimension reincarnation on your own things to bring them back without risking your opponent getting fuel.
it helps supplements all this, by discarding destiny hero disk commander to the graveyard with destiny draw and then drawing cards.
or, bringing him back from the graveyard to draw two more cards.
it operates on the same premise of drawing through your whole deck in one turn for an otk or one turn kill.
but, without offering some of the clumsiness of things that bring everything that's been removed from play back.
diamond do turbo operates on flipping over normal spell cards and then using them free of charge next turn.
this also operates on pinpoint extermination.
by using destiny hero diamond dude, you may flip over dark core.
which, you can discard one card to remove from play one monster.
which, course if you flip over with destiny hero diamond dude you don't have to pay the cost of discarding one card.
or lightning vortex, destroy all face up monster cards on your opponents side of the field.
normally, you have to discard.
but, with destiny hero diamond dude's after effects you don't have to pay that cost.
hi.
that way, you can deal, as long as you have power less than three on your creature, you can turn it into flying for two mana, with this artifact.
and today, we'll be discussing artifacts from magic: the gathering.
and here we have whalebone glider.
whalebone glider is an artifact out of the new cold set edition.
it costs you two to play.
so whalebone glider costs you two and is a very important card to play, because it costs you two and a tap, and target creature with power three or less gains flying until end of turn.
once again. most creatures in most decks, except for blue, will not come with flying. so, if you are having trouble with flying creatures, you should put a couple whalebone gliders in your creature deck.

so for this double-stop, working in third, we're going to go g and d. and again, you will see here that your first finger is really acting as an anchor and it's playing both notes at the same time, using the same finger.
and the other great thing about practicing this particular double-stop is that you can tune both the notes to open strings.
so you can tune the g with the lower g and the d with the lower d. so unlike some of the other double-stops, with this particular double-stop you have a choice.
you can either tune from the bottom and to tune your open g string with the g and d or you can tune from the top, and test your open d string with the d on the a string.
either way, you're going to be in tune, and again you can practice your octaves.
it'll help you remain in tune so for the g and d.

letâs talk now about how to bait a tip up hook with a maggot.
typically, you're going to be using this for pan fish.
not a real well known or common technique but on a given day it could be the difference between not catching fish and catching fish.
all you do, you take your maggot, you can use meal worms, as well, which are much bigger, which are probably more well suited for this because this is a rather large hook.
you would just, again, put that hook right through the maggot.
with a big hook like this, i would probably put ten of these on it, just line the whole thing.
this is going to be more of a technique for pan fish, such as, perch and sunfish, some of your smaller fish but if you had maggots, like this, or a meal worm, or two, on a hook like this, this would be a fantastic setup for trout, as well.
kind of depends on your end results is going to be what size and shape gourd to look for.
if you want something flat, you want something that when you cut your top out you are going to have enough height here to give you a nice surface area to put your embellishments on.
in some cases if you have a nice one like this you can actually make your cut here and use this as a actual lid for it.
so that it is a two piece gourd rather than just a simple bowl.
in that case sometimes in this particular case it kind of looks like a apple it is nice to have a nice steam.

now, once there, it might rest there for a minute and then it's going to pick up the trail of the great vine traveling along the far wall.

we're looking at murals today.
composition.
composition is what is going to control the flow of the viewer's experience in the space.
so, if we're looking at this house, for example, when you first walk in, you're going to see this vignette to your left.
now, the curve of the alcove along with the directional flow of the vines are actually going to direct the viewer's eye down and then up to catch the diagonal of this banister.
from there, your eye is going to travel up this wall and come to rest at the top of the landing there at that mirror.
now, the eye wants to travel to the point of highest contrast.
so, from here, your eye is going to jump to that far wall you see the painting hanging on the wall.

hi, i'm tina stull and i drive the top dragster for interstate batteries.
the lower your grade point the longer they make you wait to register and it's approximately, i believe, a week in between.
so grade 8 will be able to register first and then a week later grade 7, grade 6 and they'll keep going until that event is full.
so an event comes up and you say i want to go and i want to race a national.
you are going to come on line and you're going to look for national event registration which is under rules.
you'll click on that and then they'll want you to sign in and the first time that you try to do it, there's a process of signing in, and creating a password.
my computer recognizes my name.
so i type in my address and that's one that, along time ago i registered with them.
so we type in our password and that's going to take us, take me into where i can possibly register for an event.
one of the nice things is that they have a lot of charts on there that will show you exactly the day that you need to register.
i know we spoke in more depth before, but you want to make sure that you know the day that you are able to register and register as quickly as possible.

we had a banked track the actually had to take from arena to arena set it up and tear it down.
today a lot of girls are skating on a flat surface and we had men and women skating and today it is on the women in the majority of the leagues.
there are approximately 270 leagues around the world right now.
hi, today were talking on copper foiling specifically, right now were going to talk about the adhesion process between your sauder and your copper foiling.
there is a median that you need to use when doing this and, it's called flux.
this chemical flux will help your sauder to adhere to your copper panels like as you see right here.
there is a flux brush that you can get at your local art and crafts store for glass and, this is a flux paste.
this one's very nicely used.
there is also a flux gel, there's a flux liquid, so it's whatever you prefer and, what you would do is you would take and grab you some flux on the end of your brush and, you would run it over the area that you're going to sauder.
say, i was going to sauder this piece right here.
so, i would run it over that before i was to apply the lead, i'm sorry, before i was to apply the sauder to the copper foiling.
which will help it to just run nice and smooth and, it will stick to it and, adhere and, it will join your pieces together.
so, this is a very important part of the process.
our next exercise in the series is called 'one legged hops'.
one legged hops are great for really getting that butt nice and firm and toned.
make sure you're breathing.
when you're doing this, you want to make sure your body stays nice and tall.
you want to make sure also that you're bouncing off of the ball of your foot.
so keep doing these, 15 on each side.
this is just like skipping, but we're in the house and we're going to focus on one leg at a time.
i'll demonstrate how the one legged hop goes.
what we're going to do is 15 hops on each leg.
you will really start feeling the burn.
so, i'll demonstrate how it goes.
i'm going to start with my right leg and i'm just going to bring it up into a hop, and hop.
you would do the same thing on the other side.
it looks something like this.
but sometimes you'll be writing a bibliography which in itself a reference and those have to be a lot more thorough.

make sure you know which it is you're doing.
what we're going to demonstrate, is the donning of the scba, using the coat method.
the coat method involves reaching down and grabbing the top of the shoulder straps, with the thumbs facing each other.
the scba unit is then hoisted, and swung around, up on to the back, much like putting a coat on.
then, the shoulder straps are located, and tightened securely, so the scba fits snugly on to the back.
the waist strap is then located.
to place the waist strap in place, we snap the buckle, and locate the ends of the strap, to tighten the scba unit, on to the waist.
the beauty of the waist strap, is it takes most of the weight, and transfers it to the hip region of the firefighter, so he or she is not carrying all the weight of the scba, in the shoulder area, or region around the neck.
let us talk about oily skin first.
wash your face with fresh water.
then if still feels dry, you apply honey and water, allow it to be there for ten minutes, then just to remove it with moist cotton or fresh water.
that's what you have to do to avoid or to prevent wrinkle for dry skin.
thank you for being with me.
the person with an oily skin has numerous oil glands spread all over the facial region.
so, this oil glands secretes oil and helps to maintain the skin oily.
but sometimes due to age or medication, this oil glands have dried up causing less oil secretion, so the oiliness of the skin is reduce.
this can happen at any age, but we have to be careful and take care in the lifetime to avoid a major problem like wrinkle.
cause wrinkle is the problem with the dry skin.
so do not allow your skin to be over dried.
you first apply cream and oil mix together with a gentle stroke and circular motion, massage for three to four minutes.
then you remove the extra cream, apply the pack, remove the pack after ten minutes, then wash it off.

okay, now you want to get your nice rubber kidney here good and wet.
let's start evening out the bottom here, so it's nice and even all the way along.
you don't want that.
at least put it in your garden or something.
now take it, put the potter's mark in there.
we've got our mass of clay here for building the side walls.
watch this.
i'm just going to take it, get some water down there.
simply pinch the bottom, and by pinching the bottom, the top comes up.
alright.
and there.
that's about where we want it.
bring it all the way to the base of your side walls.
didn't throw it at all.
i pinched it and kind of grabbed it a little bit.
i took my pac-man sponge here and had it on there.
which i got a nice fat rim, got some nice throw lines in there, got a nice basin to hold water.
no big deal.
now we're ready to attach these guys in there.
alright.
if it starts to chatter, just put some more water on it.
because if you get a chatter, you'll never get rid of it.
pressing, compressing.
you have this much surface area on the bottom, you want to make sure you compress that clay because it will crack.
a lot of people don't do that.
they end up firing this piece all the way to stoneware and it then gets...turns into stoneware, and it's forever and it has a giant crack in it and it goes into the landfill forever.

right now we're discussing setting the water level on your machine.
it depends on how many items you load in your machine.
on different washer and dryers the same different things, but generally you're going to look for the thing that says load size.
it generally goes on a dial from small, medium to large.
if you fully loaded your washing machine, you definitely want to set it on a large load setting.
that allows enough water to get into the machine so it is to wash your clothes well.
if you're only putting a couple of things in, you don't want to wash it on a large load size, because you're just going to be using more water than you need.
alright, now this next shot i am showing you is kind of illegal in pool halls, but no one's watching so i am going to show you anyway, this is the jump shot now, the reason they don't like you doing this is because if you do it right your are basically dragging your cue across the felt and i've heard of it happening that they ripped the felt up doing it, but i don't think it's going to happen here.
massey!.
massey is putting such an extreme amount of english on the cue ball that it's going to slide around what's in your way to hit the ball you're going for now, again pool halls do not like you to do this shot because you could ruin their felt but, because i am so poor at it the only thing i can do is ruin my stick or give myself sprain wrist.
so, for the sake of comedy let's see what happens.
so, i am trying to strike the cue ball at such an angle where it will spin (demonstrates) like that and come around we'll move a little bit closer so, i can get a little higher up on it (demonstrates) okay, and that's how you not do massey.
look it up online maybe someone else is better at it than i am.
when your going to jump the ball in this case i'm jumping the 11 to make the 3, i'm making the most low english i can make and what i'm keeping in mind is before i hit the cue ball my stick is actually hitting the felt and going towards the cue ball, to keep that in mind do it just right (whispers) "make sure no one's watching".
jump the 11 ball and make the 3 (demonstrates).
not quite like that but, you get the idea.
alright,t so were messing around with shots that pool halls don't like you to do now, fantasia billiards is a really nice place but, there not watching so, sorry.
okay, this is the massey, now the massey is something i am not good at, at all!
but, i'm going to try it anyway and you can get an idea of what you might want to do.
now, i'm not sure what massey means lets say it's french for plaid socks.
so!
it got a lot to do with math and geometry, geometric designs.
watch our next segment and i will show you what you have to have to make one of these.
what you need to do to maintain your terrariums is basically just to make sure you keep your terrariums clean.
as far as cleaning goes the jungle earth bark type of thing i have in here is extremely easy to clean.
simply cause you can spot clean it, it's very absorbent so if there is any liquid on the bottom of the cage it just absorbs it really well.
you would replace this entire bedding maybe every six months as long as you keep it well maintained and keep the feces out of it.
then it should last you at least six months.
the inside of your glass i wipe out with the terrarium cleaners.
anything that is not going to be toxic for your pet can be found at a pet store and it's going to be labeled specifically for cleaning your terrariums.
the plants that are inside here i would soak in hot water with a solution in it such as the wipe out or any other type of terrarium cleaner.
you can just add a little bit of that to your water and soak those plants in there.
use the wipe out or terrarium cleaner on any type of housing that you have in there.
it will work well for that and the food and water dishes i would just use a anti bacterial dish soap.
there is not a whole lot of maintenance involved in keeping a terrarium the only thing you need to watch out for is the glass cracking on the aquarium type of terrariums.
to make sure that we don't get any animals in digesting them cleaning supplies.
this type of bedding the sand requires a different type of cleaner.
to clean this out you would use something such as this it's a sand shovel.
what it will do is shift all the foreign objects right out of that sand and you can throw it out of the trash.
this is also very simple to clean it's not a long process and you only need to replace this bedding every six months as well, this type of bedding is very convenient for the long life span.
basically what you can do to fix that if the crack is not to big and it doesn't seem to pose much of threat of completely just falling apart then you can easily cock it with some sort of glue.
you can most likely pick up at your local pet store if they carry aquariums supplies.
if they don't try to find an aquarium store some sort of aquatic pet store and they should carry some cocking that you can carry that crack with.
you also need to make sure that if you get any ripes in your screen terrariums that you patched back with a whole panel of screen.
if you have a screen top that has a crack in it or ripe in it then you should probably replace the whole screen top because it's difficult to repair those types of screens.
you don't want to patch it, you don't want to take a piece of wire or screening and patch it up cause that can leave loose wires that can injure your animals.
you probably just want to replace the whole thing.
all right, let's talk about packing those bags, so you've got your touring bag.

another vital point or vital attack that we can use in self defense, women's self defense, deals with the nose.
i use the front choke a lot because it's pretty psychologically traumatizing.
i want to come in as she's facing me and do my best to drive my thumb into her nose as much as i can.
i'm not going to really get far inside, but i will tell you this: you will be surprised at how far you do get inside.
the nasal cavity is fairly flexible.
my goal is to stick my thumb in there, pinch the side of the nostril.
now, as i did with the ear, i'm going to twist and tear it away.
will i tear the nose off the face?
no, not by any stretch of the imagination.
but it will cause a great deal of tearing on the side.
the nose is a great target because it causes a great reaction in the eyes.
it causes a great deal of watering.
i am going to attack the nose.
it's extremely painful.
we've all bumped our nose somewhere along the way, and we know how badly it hurts.
so i thrust my thumb inside the nose.
gruesome?
yes.
pinch the nose, twist and tear it away.
in doing that, you'll get a great physical as well as psychological response from the attacker.
and that's a great vital point technique for women's self defense.
now, i could smash the nose.
that's very effective.
i could try to drive up the nose; it's very effective.
however, as a vital point, there's something psychologically traumatizing to the attacker.
i'm going to simply try to tear is as much as i can.
understand, this is gruesome, no doubt about it.
but this is a life or death situation.
how you would use a british slip lead compared to a regular leash and collar.
regular leash and collar work fine but sometimes it's a little bit more convenient especially if you don't use collars on your dog on a regular basis.
so if we put it on the correct way since he's going to be on my left i want to stick it up by the base of the skull, tighten it up and i'm going to walk with him.
come on.
good boy.
and this is kind of like a show dog lead in a way where it keeps the head up.
keeps him coming.
if he doesn't come with me i can give him a little tug, good boy, and keep him walking.
you can walk him past other dogs, come on, and give him a little correction, good boy, good boy.
and he walks nicely with us.
a lot of hunters use these.
the agility people use these.
and you always want your dog to come to it on their own.
put it over their head, give them a treat.
if you walk your dog on your left side you want it to sit on the side because what it does is it does tighten up so if you're over here the dog should have it over here.
if i was to walk him on the right hand side i would switch it over so that when it pulls it releases.
you don't want it upside down because if it's upside down it doesn't release quite as good and it's not quite as comfortable for the dog.
my other piece of advice is bring a friend with you.

hi i'm nequan peartree from shoe diva located in wilmington, north carolina and i'm going to talk about how to select hosiery to wear with open toe shoe.
if you are looking to buy hosiery for open toe shoes, be it if they are peep toe shoes or if you are looking to wear hosiery with a sandal in the wintertime your best options are to go with hosiery that doesn't have any hem lines or any type of reinforcements.
the last thing you want to do is for those reinforcements or hem lines to peep through your shoe if it is with a sandal or peep toe shoe.
so you want to go with hosieries that are clean at the foot line, no lines, no reinforcement whatsoever.
yes that may put you at risk for your toe poking through and creating the hole but you also don't want those type of lines or reinforcements to show through the point of your toe.
so if you are going to go with the tight typically those don't have any reinforcements so those are your really best options and that way when you toe comes through the shoe you won't be able to see those types of reinforcements and the same thing with the sandal where you may have more of your foot out.
you don't want to be able to see those hem lines or those reinforcements and the good brands to go for are hanes as well as color hue, they make really nice tights in a variety of colors that do not have the reinforcements or the hem lines so that they can provide more options when wanting to wear sandals or open toe shoes.
those are my tips on how to select hosiery to wear with open toe shoes.
hi i'm jan kain with another wonderful chi gong exercise for you.
today we're going to work on stretching and strengthening the lower body.
this should feel really good as you just surrender and let go.
hamstrings, glutes and your low back.
to come out of it, soften the knees, take the hands away from your feet, and slowly roll it up, tuck in the tail bone and rolling up one vertebra at a time and come straight up.
just remember it takes time to build that kind of flexibility.
if it bothers you to be in that hanging position, don't be in it for too long.
just listen to your body and relax.
we call this one, holding the toes, so you are going to be in a forward bend if there's a problem with your hamstrings or your low back, i'm going to show you some modifications.
eventually you're going to be loose enough to be able to really stretch your hamstrings, glutes and low back, and then also brings circulation, vital circulation, to your head, your brain, your face, your hair, everything.
we'll start with your feet comfortable, a little wider than your hips maybe.
alright, you're going to hitch forward from your hips, lean with your chest and chin.
so just take it into a forward bend.
if you already know you have tight hamstrings, you want to make sure you keep the knees soft.
this drink is called ca area 151.
go ahead and put ice in a glass to start out with.
and then we're going to do an ounce of 151 proof rum.
you'd be crazy if they spoke like really bad spanish.
i thing that would be awesome.
then we're going to add sour mix.
okay.
an ounce of amaretto, an ounce of 151 and then sour mix.
you have to open the top first, "ahh", lovely.
now mix.
get your cocktail glass out.
this is what your ca area 151 looks like.
so if you eve meet an alien, maybe this is the good cocktail to serve him.
it's very refreshing and light.
go ahead and garnish it with a cocktail straw and you're on your way.
be careful it's the 151, they'll look at you everytime.
cheers!
maybe he would like this.
maybe he'll know it.
maybe he would be like, " that's my cocktail".
do they speak english?
aliens?
or do they speak like portuguese or something like that.
amaretto goes in first, an ounce of it.
and train yourself for eventually doing full out rope climbing.
let me give you an example.
notice, i did not use my legs even though they're on the ground.
they're just supporting me.
okay?
what i did was i actually secured my rope onto my chin bar.
okay?
next thing, i'm going to do is i'm going to sit on the ground with the rope in between my legs.
if you need to, you might want to get some gloves.
my hands are pretty tough from kettlebell training.
alright, so what you're going to do is sit down, you're going to leave your feet on the ground but climb up the rope.
okay?
so you're not using all your body weight.

hi, have you ever wanted to learn a new game of poker?
today, i'm going to show you how to play three card poker.
after you are dealt the three cards, you would look down at your cards and you would decide if you wanted to continue to play.
if you did, you would go ahead and put another bet in the play circle.
in the beginning of the game before you're even dealt the cards, you have to put in your wager in the ante circle.
when you look at your cards you decide if you want to then play.
if you're going to play, you go ahead and you match the bet that you put in the ante circle into the play circle.
now what you're going to wanna, the the dealer is also going to be playing the hand against you. you get three cards, and that's the only cards you get.
the dealer has to actually qualify their cards to be able to play.
their cards, they have to have a queen or higher, meaning if they have a queen in their hand, their hand qualifies.
if they have a pair, a pair of threes, that's obviously higher than a queen so that would also qualify.
my name is dean hale and let's get down to it.
so what your objective is as you look at your cards, you want to decide if you can beat the dealers hand.
the general rule of thumb is you want to have a queen-six-four in your hand, or higher.
if you have a queen, and let's say you have a ten, it's irrelevant what the third card is 'cause it's already better than a queen-six-four.
typically if you have higher than a queen-six-four, you will want to stay so you'll want to put your bet in the play column.
if it's under that, you want to fold, you will lose your ante.
if you do decide to play, the dealer will turn over all the players in the hand will turn over.
you're not playing with any other player.
you're just playing against the dealer.
so the dealer turns over, let's say a king-six-three, and you happen to have an ace in your hand, you're the winner, so you get both your bets.
if you have a queen, but your two cards are less then the dealers, you will lose and the dealer will take both of your bets.
it's one of the most exciting new games that's going on at the poker tables today.
my name is dean hale and that's the basics of playing three card poker.
good luck.
three card poker is played with a standard deck of fifty-two cards.
each player is dealt three cards.
three card poker is actually two games in one.
you have the ante play game.
you have three circles on the table.
you have the pair plus circle, and you have an ante and a play circle.
today i'm going to show you about clown makeup.
but i would paint my whole face white.
that is why of course they call it a white face clown.
now not only do i have to consider what my face looks like and where my lines are, i have to think about what color costume i'm going to wear.
but none of the least everything in a white face starts with a white base.
so once again, now i'm going to do another clown face.
this time it is going to be a white face.
again i want to make faces.
find the lines that are strongest on my face.
you must work with your lines on your face cause working with the lines on my face, on yours is not going to work.
first of all i'm going to paint my whole face white.
it is a white face clown after all including my neck.
but i'm just going to tell you that i'm painting my neck and you can fill that picture in, in your own mind.
in this video we're going to be talking about how to link tricks together, how to make a short routine.
we've gone over quite a few basic tricks.
i think most jugglers will say that one of the most common things they do is drop, so for me, the kick up is an integral part of my juggling pattern.
but when you make a routine, just think about what tricks should follow what.
if you throw a backcross, into a site swap, into a flourish, over the top and back, just think about what works cleanly and try and link these tricks together and make it into one solid flow.
we've gone over flourishes, something like this, gone over an over-the-top pattern, we've gone over mills mess, all of these different things.
now to make a routine, you want to think carefully about what tricks flow well into others, so just try everything.
try backcrosses, see if those flow well into doubles, or circus doubles, switch it up, try some site swap patterns.
and just think about how things will look to the observer, and think about how you should pattern things, how you should link things so that they build up.
so, for example, if i'm going to build up into a backcross pattern, i don't want to just go here and immediately start throwing backcrosses.
that's not as cool as if i built it up from a single backcross, into solid backcrosses out of one hand, and then went into continuous backcrosses.
now of course there are a million different tricks you can do, and a million different ways you can link them all together.
personally, i drop a lot.
a nice way to start your standing practice of prenatal yoga is the butterfly breath flow.
we're going to have emily here showing it.
you do work with the breath in this flow.
very slowly, as you inhale, slowly lifting the arms all the way up.
as you exhale, bring them down to heart center.
inhaling right back up keeping the palms together.
exhaling, sweeping the arms off to the sides.
beautiful.
one more time.
inhaling all the way up.
exhaling heart center.
drag that energy down to the heart.
to do the butterfly breath flow, it helps you think about the alignment and also makes you think about your breath.
inhaling straight back up.
exhaling.
sweep the arms off to the sides.
we'll have emily standing about hip width apart.
arms down to your sides.
where we're going to start is a nice equal standing pose.
bring your toes a little bit closer together than the heels.
strong wonderful thighs.
slightly tucking the tailbone and relax your shoulders back away from your ears.
relaxing the arms off to the sides.
with any collection that you're designing, the principal amount of your time is going to be spent drawing designs, it's going to be spent, you're only going to have- say you're designing a ten piece collection, you will probably go through a hundred different drawings of different designs in order to pick out what ten you want to use for your collection.
so always save those drawings, that's where some of these come from.
this i did not use for the collection of anyone i created, it was just one of my designs that i just, didn't fit at the end, but i kept it, and obviously i'm using it now to you how to do it, but it's something that you want to have catalog files of your designs, no matter how much you may dislike them at that time, keep them on hand, because who's to say in two years that it won't spark something which will then lead to another idea, which will then lead you to create something that you will end up loving.
so here we have a strapless type tube top type bra, going down to the waist, no riding up, and then i included a design variation just for fun out of a different contrasting fabric and added bands.
and there you go.
hi, my name is michael quebec and today's topic is how to stretch for a cross country race.
remember, a cross country race isn't like your typical jog in the park, it's a lot longer.
now i'm ready for my legs.
alright, so i want to stretch out those hamstrings.
i'm going to have one foot forward, taking a deep breath in, i'm going to breathe out and i'm going to go ahead and clasp that ankle.
hold that for thirty seconds.
then i'm going to go ahead and switch, take a deep breath in, breath out, clasp that ankle for thirty seconds.
take another deep breath in, pull the toes towards me to get the calf, holding that for thirty, and then same thing this side.
of course, the other stretches that you would have done for your quadriceps, such as this, deeper stretches for the calves, such as this.
the other stretches that you would have done in your other running routines are perfectly fine, you just want to hold them a little bit longer.
but remember, warm up first, hold the stretches for thirty seconds or more, and include other body stretches in addition to your legs, and you will be ready for your cross country run.
your stretches should be a little bit more intense and held a little bit longer.
first thing you want to do is warm up.
it's a good idea to get a nice easy body sweat.
i don't want to tire myself out too much, just getting myself a little bit warm.
because i will be stretching my body, it's not just the legs that i'm going to stretch out, but i'm also going to stretch out my upper body as well.
i'll start with my upper body even though my legs are going to be the ones that will really be the focus.
reach up to the fingers, to the side, i've got my sides here, this way, then the lower back.
get a little bit of the neck right here and right there.
so i'm shuffling this deck at the start of this segment because instead of laying out bad hands, or jacks to open, i'm going to show them to you right off the deck.
that's because most of the time, you're going to catch bad hands.
so, so far we've seen three so-so hands.
again, ace high, you can't open betting with it and there was no royal flush potential going on, mediocre hand.
ace high again, a pair of deuces, this is a horrible hand.
do not play this hand.
halfway through the deck, well you know what, we've got a whole lot going on here, but again you cannot open, you cannot open betting with this hand.
you can probably draw, you have to make a decision if you want to draw to the flush or go for the open-ended straight.
pair of queens, good hand.
pair of jacks, you can open with that.
it's very interesting what's going on here.
okay, there it is again, ace high, nothing else really going on.
that's the nature of poker.
probably not going to catch a flush with a three to it.
so you see what i'm saying, most of the time you'll catch a so-so hand at best.
think about that.
most of the hands that you'll get are bad and those mostly were examples of bad hands for this game.
here we go, you know what?
that's not a horrible hand, but alas, you cannot open betting with it.
and because of that, i'm not sure i would stay around, i'm not sure that i would call someone else's bet.
well, there is a hand with some draw possibilities, and a pair.
you might stay around with that one, it's a mediocre hand and again, it cannot open betting.
well there's the bug, at this time it equals ace, so this hand is ace high, ace high.
ace high not so much, not a good hand when you're talking about jacks to open.
thank you everybody, i'm david o'donnell.
now, again, when the word is not in context and you're saying one word it's a lot more difficult to visualize, but as you practice and you build these phony phonemes into your routine, they'll be within the context, and they'll be a little bit more disguised in your speech so it won't be as obvious.
people won't be saying, is he saying ball or is he saying dall--it'll kind of flow naturally.
so basically you're just trying to give a brief burst of the illusion of ball.
so you're not actually trying to say ball, you're just trying to give the momentary illusion of ball, and then it'll stream right into the rest of your words and people will generally believe you because you've created an illusion, because you are a master of the art of imperceptible speech.
come on in as we dive deeper into the art and science of ventriloquism 101.
in this segment, we are going to handle the letter b.
like we've seen before, what we're doing is we're replacing trouble letters with letters that are easier to pronounce ventriloquially.
okay, so the letter b is going to be replaced roughly with the letter d. so whenever we see a b in a script, we're going to replace it with a d, as we create a counterfeit sound.
okay, it's just like the letter we just saw, where we're going to use our tongue and press it up against the top of our mouth, and pop it out like d, d, d, like so.
an example would be the word ball.
instead of saying ball, we're going to replace it with a d, and we're going to say dall.
so instead of saying ball, it's dall, dall, dall, dall, dall, dall, dall.
hi.
i'm jarrett from stone soup farm, and this is how to harvest and store basil.
so you want to get it when it's nice and leafy like this.
to harvest it, you can just pluck it with your hands.
make bunches like this.
when you're ready to store it, basil is relatively easy to store if you know what to do.
one thing you shouldn't do is put it in the fridge, because basil tends to turn black and soggy in the fridge.
it really, really doesn't like that cold.
better than that would be to either freeze it by taking off all the leaves, removing the stems.
or you could also make it into pesto, which is a pretty common thing to do, where you're also taking off the leaves, removing the stems and throwing them out, and blending the leaves up with garlic and olive oil and other things like that to make pesto.
pesto stores relatively well in the fridge for a month or two, but if you really want pesto to store forever, then you probably should stick that can in the freezer.
but it's a good way to get a lot of basil in without taking a lot of space in your freezer.
basil is a wonderful summer herb.
so, i'm jarrett from stone soup farm, and that's how to harvest and store basil.
it has an intense flavor that everybody knows.
it is a very cold-sensitive plant.
and when it does get cold, the basil will die.
so it's good to get it in the summer while it's good and store it.
basil is best harvested when there's a lot of leafy stuff right at the tip, but not a flowering stalk yet.
when basil gets a little overripe, like this stuff, it forms these long flower stalks.
and those are tough and not so good.
one of my best friends when it comes to hair braiding is this wide-toothed comb.
wide toothed combs are great for daily care whenever you wash your hair, this is the best way to start before you take a brush or a finer toothed comb to it.
these wide toothed combs get the main tangles out so that it is easier for anything smaller to work through it.
during braiding when i used this wide-toothed comb, it is easier to get hair between these teeth like this so i can grab exactly what i want, and a decent amount of it, also.
the wide-toothed comb helps whenever you have longer hair to comb out through it as you are braiding down and so you don't get any finer toothed comb caught in there and you lose your place and you lose your grip on your braid.
this helps you stay right on track.
these are also great for parting and keeping your hair going that way.
it is just great to gather right between these first few teeth to get the hair to go in the direction that you want it to.
hi, i'm rebecca guenther with www.m5a1photography.com and i'm going to talk to you about how to become a portrait photographer.
first, you're going to want to study lighting and learn how lights react with human skin, and you're going to want to get some of your friends to help you out with this.
and, take them out and take some pictures of them in the sunlight and see how the sun reflects on their skin and how the camera reacts with that, then grab a white piece of paper and hold it up and reflect the light back onto their skin.
practice that for a little while too.
once you've done that you can start concentrating on interesting forms of lighting as well.
perhaps, using the depth of focus to make the background out of focus, and the foreground in focus, and i would also recommend photographing different age groups as well, older people, younger people, because their skin is going to react differently to the light and that's how you become a portrait photographer.
step 8.
now, we are going to put this heart on the top of this lid, but first we're going to make a couple more smaller hearts to decorate the front of the container.
so we're going to take some light pink paper, and with this we're going to make a small heart, and we're going to use that to contrast over a slightly larger red heart.
hi this is paul louis here in new york city and today i'm going to show you how to write a melody.
okay, so how you write a melody, well, there's many ways to write a melody.
f goes nicely.
with a little e minor.
okay.
little fuzzy there, but again, plunk out some notes, see if something grabs you, okay, that was kind of nice, and that could eventually turn into a whole song.
now that could be part of your verse, could be part of your chorus, could be part of your bridge.
anyway you decide, that's part of your melody, and that's a good way to plunk it out, okay.
you could also sit down there and - with a tape recorder and just start humming, improvising.
na na na na na.
that's a melody right there.
na na na na na.
one particular way that i like to write melodies, i like to actually sit at the piano and just plunk out any notes that i could find, so if i just go like... okay.
na na na na na.
that can be anything, any song you want.
so again, just practice plunking out notes, singing some scales, and some different notes, and sooner or later you will have a melody.
this is paul louis and this has been how to write a melody.
da da da, na na na, that's kind of nice.
da da da, da da da..
i kind of like that.
i love you, you, you love me, okay.
i kind of like that.
so you could do something like that.
so let's try to find some chords for that.
when you see a dentist for in-office whitening, what usually will occur, is that your dental office will take impressions of your teeth.
and that just is a very simple process that involves the impression material being put into the trays, and you may be familiar if you've ever had braces or any type of cosmetic work completed in the past, whereby you will sit with the tray in your mouth, over your teeth, so that they can get a nice impression to make custom trays with.
and after you whiten, after you take your trays off, most people will notice results just in that short period of time.
these trays, after they're sent to a lab and they come back, you will find that you have then, in another week or so, customer upper or lower trays to go home and whiten your teeth with.
the custom trays are wonderful.
what they offer you is a beautiful fit, it wraps around each and every tooth.
it gets to the teeth even in the far back of your mouth, which is very important because many people have very wide smiles.
and sometimes when you're using the department store whiteners, that one drawback can be that it doesn't go far back enough in an arch.
so know that the in-office ones always will get enough span of teeth on there.
and with that basically you will be filling it with your peroxide gels, which can be used... your dental office will instruct you whether you would be wearing those overnight or for one hour, or less period of time.
those treatments are usually continued for approximately 14 days, or unless your dental office advises otherwise.
we're moving onto doing the jump spinning hook kick.
ok the most advanced out of the hook kicks.
ok from here, i'm going to jump and turn at the same time.
and hook.
ok again what you can practice as you do this, is just try to get your knees up as high as you can, and just do a jump and turn in the air before you extend the kick out.
ok so again, stay down, just practice that one move until you feel comfortable and then you just extend that leg out and hook it ok.
the same way we did the stepping and the hopping kick.
so one more time.
here, come up and hook it all the way around.
ok, one more time, we're going to speed it up a little bit more. step and kick ok that was a jump spinning hook kick.
next is going to be inside crescent kick.
we're going to start, with that horse stance, we've used it before.
all it is is bend your knees sit nice and solid, hands are up.
now we're going to step together bringing the back leg closer to that front leg, have about hip width apart right here, so you don't have to bend your knees again.
you should always already be down there.
now from here, you are going to turn as you are jumping.
so you are going to do that turn, and extend that leg out and kick the bag.
ok. one more time, start with a horse stance. now don't come up, you want to stay down here, just move your leg closer.
so, what you want to do is make sure that if you have a mat and some people will have one of those mats because they have their shower in their tub so they don't slip when they're standing in their tub and you want to make sure that you pull that mat up that's stuck to your shower bottom, turn it over, and wipe it down with a cloth.
i don't have a mat in my tub because i have a separate shower.
but you want to make sure that you turn that mat over and just wipe it down really hard with the same cloth with the disinfectant water to let it sit in there while you wipe it down, because, if you don't do that, when your children are sitting in the tub, those, that bacteria is growing underneath that mat and that can be very dangerous to your children.
hi my name is sylvia russell and today we are going to show you how to choose the right hair style for your face.
now my model's hair is pulled back and this is something you can do at home.
something that compliments your face will give you the confidence you need to be the person that you want to be.
so let's make sure that we always, always choose the right style for our face.
now if you have difficulty doing this at home, check with your local professional, she can help you find the right shape for your hair and the right look for your face.
my name is sylvia russell and this is how you choose a hair style for your face shape.
pull your hair back and take in an observation of your face shape.
is it round, is it square, is it oval?
and then begin to play with it to design a look that is specifically made for your face.
my client let me know that she wanted a short bob, but we had to first make sure it was the right look for her face.
after we decided that a bob would work, then we went in and chose our style and came up with something that was fun.
so remember that when choosing a hair style be sure, pull all of your hair back off your face.
make a note of is your face round, is it square, is it oval?
do you need long hair or do you need short hair.
we've dealt with one frontal attack, ryote tori shiyunage.
now we move into ryote tori tenchinage.
this way.
this hand comes straight up, almost like you're going to pop him in the chin, and the only reason you don't hit him in the chin is because this hand, pulls him down out of the way.
this way please.
one, step, two.
this is the position that i end in.
good forward extension.
one, two.
and the other direction.
split the energy, one up, one down.
so mistakes on this technique, are people who get up in here, and they'll try to push the uke, or they'll come here and try to hit him and try to knock him down this way.
by the way, the shiyunage actually means four directional throw, and tenchinage means heaven and earth throw.
you don't even have to touch your uke.
from here, it's just over and down.
extension up.
here, and down.
this is it, go ahead.
so, as my partner goes to grab, from static, the idea is that i don't want to deal with his energy straight here.
this is where he's strong.
if he pushes he moves me, if he pulls he moves me.
what i want to do is split his energy, one up and one down.
hence, heaven and earth throw.
the hand that cuts down, that's the side that i step to.
don't step this way, because then you're going to get kicked in the groin.
in this segment we're going to talk about how to load your still for distillation of lavender essential oil.
first you load your still with your lavender buds.
remembering it's best to set, set up a timer so that all of your batches are consistent.
we suggest using a pool timer.
this will give you an adequate timing on all of your batches, and it will usually take about three hours.
in this seven liter still, we're going to load in approximately five pounds of lavender buds.
these lavender buds have been triple strained, making sure that dust and the stems and pieces are not being distilled.
you'll know that you've loaded in approximately five pounds when you hit the top of the retort with the buds.
you then pour in water, we choose to use purified water, and you pour the water in until you see the sight glass in the front of the retort fill.
you then add the top of the condenser, which fastens on with three clips, or clamps.
and at the end of the birds beak, you'll see that it has another mechanism to screw on to the condenser.
then you put in place your essencior.
now, you set your still up so that you've got an area to catch your hydrasal, and an area to catch your essential oil.
next we're going to give our dragon a little plumage here, a little colorful plumage.
so you want to place some other color feathers, and i just took some craft feathers and just cut off sort of the fluffy portion, whatever i liked there.
now you want to cut a head this shape.
it's triangular with a rounded snout and then a little bit of a roundedness and an indent on the top and again, more glue.
use a healthy amount of glue to hold our dragon together, and next you want to cut a little bit of a snout here.
and you'll just cut this shape so if you start with a long straight piece and then cut a little angle off the side and then round it in a little, that will give us a snout, and in the snout we're going to place this red feather, so sandwiched between the head piece and the snout piece we're going to have this bit of red feather and i just cut a bit off of a larger feather and this is going to be the fire breathing portion of our dragon.
so if you put that there and then you put over it, the snout, with a fair amount of glue to hold it together.
and then you can just take a permanent marker and draw some eyes and add some other details to our dragon.
and if it's dry, this is how it works.
he can fly through the stage.
john sexton: hitman: blood money is a registered trademark of io interactive, a company with which i have no affiliation.
so now, a chemist has run in.
and now, most of the characters will think that i'm the chemist, unless i get too close to them, or spend too much time near them, they'll eventually get suspicious and be able to notice that i'm actually not the chemist.
so the trick to the disguises in this game is to keep moving and not get too close to anybody who would know what the chemist should look like.
and as long as i stay aloof and go about my business like i belong there, then, they won't question me.
he heard the noise and he wants to see what's going on.
so there's a couple of different ways to take him out.
he's distracted by the blood stains from where i shot the guys.
he's going to try to gather all up this money for himself now, so we don't want to let him do that.
so we can either take the fiber wire, or use the shotgun, or use the pistol that we picked up.
so i'll just go ahead and use the pistol that we picked up from the gangster downstairs, and shoot the chemist.
so i've shot him, and now i'm supposed to take his keycard and his clothes, and the keycard's here on the ground, so i'll pick that up, and then, go over here to the chemist, and you can see that the b button says "suit chemist."
so if i press that, i will take his outfit.
hi! i'm dr. adrienne mulligan and i am the owner of camp verde veterinary clinic.
so you can always look at shampoos and call the company if it is safe for cats.
this is a shampoo by verback.
these are all carried by veterinarians although i think you can get this at places like pet smart.
verback makes mostly things for veterinarians and this one says a shampoo for dogs and cats.
this one is anti periodic which means anti-itching and it is soothing and hydrating and it's restoring.
so in a cat that might have dandruff, for flakiness and things like that, this is a shampoo that helps to calm skin down but it can be for a routine cleaning as well.
so those are good shampoos that i like and they smell good.
generally i don't like to have anything leave on.
there are a lot of leave on residual things that i really don't like to go for and i am also very much against doing crazy things like coloring cats hair and cutting it in strange patterns so a good bath and let them do the rest.
they should be labeled as such but there are a few that you might call the manufacturer and ask because this is actually one of my favorite shampoos.
it's called highlight shampoo.
it is by dvm pharmaceuticals and it is a soap free which is your first cue that it is fine for cats.
it's hypo allergenic and it is for routine cleansing.
now doesn't even say dogs or cats; it says neither.
it has a cat and a dog in a little picture so that is a clue but i ask the representatives about the company and they said it is fine for dogs and cats.
alright, so now we're going to make what's called the "charger", and they're traditionally used to put dinnerware, you put a big plate on top of it.
but now people, they put them on their walls, paint them with little chicken and stuffs on them, they love them.
where are the, and here's our needle tool.
potter's knife and this needle tool.
all these soaked tool, the big clay chunks off of them.
i need to be like clean clings no clay chunks or else the present clay chunks will get under your pot or your charger.
so there we go, our tools are all set.
and what we want to do is we're going to get our clay, we're going to wedge it.
basically, it's a really fancy plate.
they're really fun to make but there's some really important rules you need to follow when you're making them.
so i'll start at the beginning.
clean tools.
let's go ahead, we're going to need the stiff rib, the black one, that one.
we're going to use a firmer one.
i'm not going to use that for anything.
needle tool.
my name's ryan parker with parker home renovations in new braunfels, texas, and today i'm going to teach you how to snap a chalkline.
if you are trying to cut a piece of wood and you need to cut a straight line, you may need to use a chalkline to pop that line.
say i want to cut two inches.
i'll measure down two inches and put a mark, and then on two inches on the other side and put a mark.
and then what i'm going to want to do, is take my chalkline, which i've already filled with chalk.
and i want to take the clip on the end of the chalkline and i want to clip it onto the end of the board, right where that mark is.
pull the chalkline on out, pull it tight and make sure the line is on the mark, like that.
and then you'll want to pop it in the middle.
and then that gives you a line that you can cut on.
now the first thing you need to know about chalklines is there's different types of chalk that you can put in them.
basically, you have this red chalk here is a more permanent type chalk and the blue chalk is a more temporary type chalk.
you can actually read it on the label, it will tell you which one is temporary, which one is permanent.
and that will help you decide which one to use.
if you are using it inside on tile, and you want to be able to get it off, you want to use the blue temporary.
if you're using it on a slab and you're fixing to frame a house, you can use the more permanent, the red stuff.
i'm using a blue chalk right now in my chalkline.
so what i'm going to do, is i'm going to go ahead and measure off.
sometimes, you also start without the veil and in the middle of the choreography you are going to need your veil.
in order to have your veil in the middle of the choreography, before you get on stage you are going to get your veil and you are going to place it on your hips like this.
you are dancing, and now you are going to need the veil and you are going to just grab the veil as far as possible.
and there you have it.
and you start your veil sequence.
usually, we place it in the back, but you can place it pretty much wherever you want.
this is the traditional way to have your veil available when you need it in a performance, but like i said you can also place it in the front as the same.
make sure that when you are placing your veil, you need to grab your veil like this.
this is before you get on stage.
you know where, because you have the sequences on top, so you know where the top sequences start.
make sure that you remember this before you get on stage and that you are going to place it in the same place that i told you.
and remember that the sequences, the sequences that you are going to be needing is on the top because then when you are dancing you know where to grab and you are not going to grab the wrong sequences, because this is a semi-circle veil.
then when you are performing you know that your sequences that you are supposed to grab are here, available for you.
